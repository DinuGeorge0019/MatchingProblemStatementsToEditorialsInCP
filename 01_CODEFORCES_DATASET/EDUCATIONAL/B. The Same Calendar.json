The Same Calendar", "statement": "The girl Taylor has a beautiful calendar for the year . In the calendar all days are given with their days of week: Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday and Sunday.The calendar is so beautiful that she wants to know what is the next year after  when the calendar will be exactly the same. Help Taylor to find that year.Note that leap years has  days. The year is leap if it is divisible by  or it is divisible by , but not by  (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leap_year).", "input": "The only line contains integer  () \u2014 the year of the calendar.", "output": "Print the only integer  \u2014 the next year after  when the calendar will be the same. Note that you should find the first year after  with the same calendar.", "tutorial": "Two calendars are same if and only if they have the same number of days and starts with the same day of a week. So we should simply iterate over years and maintain the day of a week of January, 1st (for example). Easy to see that the day of a week increases by one each year except of the leap years, when it increases by two.\n", "solution": "int y;\n\nbool read() {\n\treturn !!(cin >> y);\n}\n\nbool leap(int y) {\n\treturn y % 400 == 0 || (y % 4 == 0 && y % 100 != 0);\n}\n\nvoid solve() {\n\tbool is_leap = leap(y);\n\tint d = 0;\n\tdo {\n\t\td++;\n\t\tif (leap(y)) d++;\n\t\ty++;\n\t\td %= 7;\n\t} while (d || leap(y) != is_leap);\n\tcout << y << endl;\n}", "interactive": false, "noSolution": false, "noTutorial": false}
