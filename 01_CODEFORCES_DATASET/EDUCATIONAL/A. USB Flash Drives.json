USB Flash Drives", "statement": "Sean is trying to save a large file to a USB flash drive. He has  USB flash drives with capacities equal to  megabytes. The file size is equal to  megabytes. Find the minimum number of USB flash drives needed to write Sean's file, if he can split the file between drives.", "input": "The first line contains positive integer  () \u2014 the number of USB flash drives. The second line contains positive integer  () \u2014 the size of Sean's file. Each of the next  lines contains positive integer  () \u2014 the sizes of USB flash drives in megabytes. It is guaranteed that the answer exists, i. e. the sum of all  is not less than .", "output": "Print the minimum number of USB flash drives to write Sean's file, if he can split the file between drives.", "tutorial": "Let's sort the array in nonincreasing order. Now the answer is some of the first flash-drives. Let's iterate over array from left to right until the moment when we will have the sum at least m.
