Then the test cases follow, each test case consists of one line containing one integer  ().", "output": "For each test case, print one integer without any leading zeroes \u2014 the result of your changes (i.\u2009e. the integer that is divisible by  and can be obtained by changing the minimum possible number of digits in ). If there are multiple ways to apply changes, print any resulting number. If the given number is already divisible by , just print it.", "tutorial": "A lot of different solutions can be written in this problem. The model solution relies on the fact that every -th integer is divisible by , and it means that there is always a way to change the last digit of  (or leave it unchanged) so that the result is divisible by . So, if  is already divisible by , we just print it, otherwise we change its last digit using some formulas or iteration on its value from  to .", "solution": "t = int(input())\nfor i in range(t):\n    n = int(input())\n    if n % 7 == 0:\n        print(n)\n    else:\n        ans = -1\n        for j in range(10):\n            if (n - n % 10 + j) % 7 == 0:\n                ans = n - n % 10 + j\n        print(ans)", "interactive": false, "noSolution": false, "noTutorial": false}
