Strange Functions", "statement": "Let's define a function  ( is a positive integer) as follows: write all digits of the decimal representation of  backwards, then get rid of the leading zeroes. For example, , , , .Let's define another function  ( is a positive integer as well).Your task is the following: for the given positive integer , calculate the number of different values of  among all numbers  such that .", "input": "The first line contains one integer  () \u2014 the number of test cases. Each test case consists of one line containing one integer  (). This integer is given without leading zeroes.", "output": "For each test case, print one integer \u2014 the number of different values of the function , if  can be any integer from .", "tutorial": "Let's analyze which values can the function  have. It can be proven that the value of  is equal to , where  is the number of zero-digits at the end of the number , because  is the same number as  except for the fact that it doesn't have any trailing zeroes.Okay, now let's analyze when we reach the new value of .  is the first value of  such that ,  is the first value of  such that ,  is the first value of  such that , and so on. We have to calculate the maximum number that has the form  and is not greater than , and the answer is exactly .It can be done with a mathematical solution, but the most simple way to do it is read  as a string instead, and calculate its length.", "solution": "for i in range(int(input())):\n\tprint(len(input()))", "interactive": false, "noSolution": false, "noTutorial": false}
