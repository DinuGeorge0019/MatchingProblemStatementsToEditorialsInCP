Queries about less or equal elements", "statement": "You are given two arrays of integers  and . For each element of the second array  you should find the number of elements in array  that are less than or equal to the value .", "input": "The first line contains two integers  () \u2014 the sizes of arrays  and . The second line contains  integers \u2014 the elements of array  (). The third line contains  integers \u2014 the elements of array  ().", "output": "Print  integers, separated by spaces: the -th of which is equal to the number of such elements in array  that are less than or equal to the value .", "tutorial": "Let's sort all numbers in a. Now let's iterate over elements of b and for element bj find the index of lowest number that is greater than bj. We can do that using binary search. That index will be the answer for value bj.\nComplexity: O(nlogn).\n", "solution": "/*\nMass inclination will fuel my frustration\nAnd keep all redemption at bay\nAll indications prove your all mutations\nAnd you all have nothing to say\n\nHate\nDown on me\nBreak\nDown on me\nSlave\nDown on me\nPlague\nDown on me\n\nI can't believe everything you believe perceive\nIs rightfully coming your way\n\nTake me back to where I need to go (Inside me)\nShow me how to question all I know (Excite me)\nYou'll come around (And reveal yourself)\nYou come down (In this best education)\nI'll fall down (As we kill ourselves)\nWhen it all goes down (Are you ready to suffer it all?)\n\nMy aggravation is manifestation\nOf all of the shit that you say\nThis complication will lead to this damnation\nOf all those who stand in my way\n\nHate\nDown on me\nBreak\nDown on me\nSlave\nDown on me\nPlague\nDown on me\n\nI can't believe everything you believe perceive\nIs rightfully coming your way\n\nTake me back to where I need to go (Inside me)\nShow me how to question all I know (Excite me)\nYou'll come around (And reveal yourself)\nYou come down (In this best education)\nI'll fall down (As we kill ourselves)\nWhen it all goes down (Are you ready to suffer it all?)\n\nTake me back to where I need to go (Inside me)\nShow me how to question all I know (Excite me)\nYou'll come around (And reveal yourself)\nYou come down (In this best education)\nI'll fall down (As we kill ourselves)\nWhen it all goes down (Are you ready to suffer it all?)\n\nI'll be ready to suffer it all\nI'll be ready to suffer it all\n*/\n\n//#pragma comment(linker, \"/STACK:16777216\")\n#include <fstream>\n#include <iostream>\n#include <string>\n#include <complex>\n#include <math.h>\n#include <set>\n#include <vector>\n#include <map>  \n#include <queue>\n#include <stdio.h>\n#include <stack>\n#include <algorithm>\n#include <list>\n#include <ctime>\n#include <memory.h>\n#include <ctime> \n#include <assert.h>\n\n#define y0 sdkfaslhagaklsldk\n#define y1 aasdfasdfasdf\n#define yn askfhwqriuperikldjk\n#define j1 assdgsdgasghsf\n#define tm sdfjahlfasfh\n#define lr asgasgash\n\n#define eps 1e-8\n#define M_PI 3.141592653589793\n#define bs 1000000007\n#define bsize 512\n\nconst int N = 200005;\n\nusing namespace std;\n\nint ar[N];\nint n,m;\n\nint main(){\n\t//freopen(\"beavers.in\",\"r\",stdin);\n\t//freopen(\"beavers.out\",\"w\",stdout);\n\t//freopen(\"F:/in.txt\",\"r\",stdin);\n\t//freopen(\"F:/output.txt\",\"w\",stdout);\n\tios_base::sync_with_stdio(0);\n\t//cin.tie(0);\n\t\n\tcin>>n>>m;\n\tfor (int i=0;i<n;i++)\n\t{\n\t\tcin>>ar[i];\n\t}\n\tsort(ar,ar+n);\n\t\n\tfor (int i=0;i<m;i++)\n\t{\n\t\tint val;\n\t\tcin>>val;\n\t\tint cnt=lower_bound(ar,ar+n,val+1)-ar;\n\t\tif (i)\n\t\t\tcout<<\" \";\n\t\tcout<<cnt;\n\t}\n\tcout<<endl;\n\treturn 0;\n}", "interactive": false, "noSolution": false, "noTutorial": false}
