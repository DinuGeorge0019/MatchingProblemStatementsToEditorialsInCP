Array Splitting", "statement": "You are given a  array  (for each index  condition  holds) and an integer .You are asked to divide this array into  non-empty consecutive subarrays. Every element in the array should be included in exactly one subarray. Let  be equal to the maximum in the -th subarray, and  be equal to the minimum in the -th subarray. The cost of division is equal to . For example, if  and we divide it into  subarrays in the following way: , then the cost of division is equal to .Calculate the minimum cost you can obtain by dividing the array  into  non-empty consecutive subarrays. ", "input": "The first line contains two integers  and  (). The second line contains  integers  (, ). ", "output": "Print the minimum cost you can obtain by dividing the array  into  nonempty consecutive subarrays. ", "tutorial": "Let's carefully look at the coefficients with which the elements of the array will be included in the answer. If pair of adjacent elements $$$a_i$$$ and $$$a_{i+1}$$$ belong to different subarrays then element $$$a_i$$$ will be included in the answer with coefficient $$$1$$$, and element $$$a_{i+1}$$$ with coefficient $$$-1$$$. So they add value $$$a_{i} - a_{i+1}$$$ to the answer.If element belongs to subarray with length $$$1$$$ then it will be included in the sum with coefficient $$$0$$$ (because it will be included with coefficient $$$1$$$ and $$$-1$$$ simultaneously). Elements at positions $$$1$$$ and $$$n$$$ will be included with coefficients $$$-1$$$ and $$$1$$$ respectively.So initially our answer is $$$a_n - a_1$$$. All we have to do is consider $$$n-1$$$ values $$$a_1 - a_2, a_2 - a_3, \\dots , a_{n-1} - a_n$$$ and add up the $$$k-1$$$ minimal ones to the answer.", "solution": "#include<bits/stdc++.h>\n\nusing namespace std;\n\nconst int N = int(3e5) + 99;\n\nint n, k;\nint a[N];\n\nint main(){\n\tcin >> n >> k;\n\tfor(int i = 0; i < n; ++i)\n\t\tcin >> a[i];\n\t\n\tvector <int> v;\n\tfor(int i = 1; i < n; ++i) v.push_back(a[i - 1] - a[i]);\n\t\n\tsort(v.begin(), v.end());\n\t\n\tint res = a[n - 1] - a[0];\n\tfor(int i = 0; i < k - 1; ++i) res += v[i];\n\t\n\tcout << res << endl;\n \treturn 0;\n}", "interactive": false, "noSolution": false, "noTutorial": false}
