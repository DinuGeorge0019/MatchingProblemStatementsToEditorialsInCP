Square Filling", "statement": "You are given two matrices  and . Each matrix contains exactly  rows and  columns. Each element of  is either  or ; each element of  is initially .You may perform some operations with matrix . During each operation, you choose any submatrix of  having size , and replace every element in the chosen submatrix with . In other words, you choose two integers  and  such that  and , and then set , ,  and  to .Your goal is to make matrix  equal to matrix . Two matrices  and  are equal if and only if every element of matrix  is equal to the corresponding element of matrix .Is it possible to make these matrices equal? If it is, you have to come up with a sequence of operations that makes  equal to . Note that you don't have to minimize the number of operations.", "input": "The first line contains two integers  and  (). Then  lines follow, each containing  integers. The -th integer in the -th line is . Each integer is either  or .", "output": "If it is impossible to make  equal to , print one integer . Otherwise, print any sequence of operations that transforms  into  in the following format: the first line should contain one integer  \u2014 the number of operations, and then  lines should follow, each line containing two integers  and  for the corresponding operation (set , ,  and  to ). The condition  should hold.", "tutorial": "It is quite obvious that we can't choose any submatrix that contains at least one zero in . The contrary is also true \u2014 if a submatrix of  consists of only ones, then there's no reason not to choose it (suppose there is an answer that does not choose it \u2014 then choosing this submatrix won't affect it).So we may perform an operation on every submatrix of  such that the corresponding submatrix in  is filled with 's, and check if our answer is correct.", "solution": "n, m = map(int, input().split())\na = [[] for i in range(n)]\nfor i in range(n):\n    a[i] = list(map(int, input().split()))\n\nans = []\nfor i in range(n - 1):\n    for j in range(m - 1):\n        if(a[i][j] * a[i][j + 1] * a[i + 1][j] * a[i + 1][j + 1] > 0):\n            a[i][j] = 2\n            a[i + 1][j] = 2\n            a[i][j + 1] = 2\n            a[i + 1][j + 1] = 2\n            ans.append([i, j])\n\ncnt1 = 0\nfor i in range(n):\n    for j in range(m):\n        if(a[i][j] == 1):\n            cnt1 += 1\n\nif(cnt1 != 0):\n    print(-1)\nelse:\n    print(len(ans))\n    for x in ans:\n        print(x[0] + 1, x[1] + 1)", "interactive": false, "noSolution": false, "noTutorial": false}
