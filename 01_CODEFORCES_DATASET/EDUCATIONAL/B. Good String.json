Good String", "statement": "You have a string  of length  consisting of only characters  and . You may do some operations with this string, for each operation you have to choose some character that still remains in the string. If you choose a character , the character that comes right after it is deleted (if the character you chose was the last one, nothing happens). If you choose a character , the character that comes right before it is deleted (if the character you chose was the first one, nothing happens).For example, if we choose character  in string , the string will become to . And if we choose character  in string , the string will become to .The string is good if there is a sequence of operations such that after performing it only one character will remain in the string. For example, the strings ,  are good. , you may remove any number of characters from the given string (possibly none, possibly up to , but not the whole string). You need to calculate the minimum number of characters to be deleted from string  so that it becomes good.", "input": "The first line contains one integer  () \u2013 the number of test cases.

Strings of type  are not good, as their first and last characters will never change and they will eventually come to the form .So, the answer is the minimum number of characters from the beginning of the string, which must be removed so that the first symbol becomes , or minimum number of characters from the end of the string, which must be removed so that the last symbol becomes .", "solution": "#include <bits/stdc++.h>\n\nusing namespace std;\n\nint t, n;\nstring s;\n\nint main(){\n\tcin >> t;\n\tfor(int tc = 0; tc < t; ++tc){\n\t\tcin >> n >> s;\n\t\tint res = n - 1;\n\t\tfor(int i = 0; i < n; ++i)\n\t\t\tif(s[i] == '>' || s[n - 1 - i] == '<')\n\t\t\t\tres = min(res, i);\n\t\t\n\t\tcout << res << endl;\n\t}\n\n\treturn 0;\n}\n", "interactive": false, "noSolution": false, "noTutorial": false}
