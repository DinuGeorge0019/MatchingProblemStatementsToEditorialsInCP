Road To Zero", "statement": "You are given two integers  and . You can perform two types of operations:   Pay  dollars and increase or decrease any of these integers by . For example, if  and  there are four possible outcomes after this operation:   , ;  , ;  , ;  , .   Pay  dollars and increase or decrease both integers by . For example, if  and  there are two possible outcomes after this operation:   , ;  , .  Your goal is to make both given integers equal zero simultaneously, i.e. . There are no other requirements. In particular, it is possible to move from ,  to .Calculate the minimum amount of dollars you have to spend on it.", "input": "The first line contains one integer  ()\u00a0\u2014 the number of testcases.

Then there are two cases in the problem:   If $$$a + a \\le b$$$ then we have to $$$x + y$$$ times perform the first operation. So the answer is $$$(x + y) \\cdot a$$$;  If $$$a + a > b$$$ then we have to $$$y$$$ times perform the second operation and pass the remaining distance by performing the first operation. So the answer is $$$y \\cdot b + (x - y) \\cdot a$$$.
