Each character is either  or .You want all 's in the string to form a contiguous subsegment. For example, if the string is , ,  or , then all 's form a contiguous subsegment, and if the string is ,  or , then this condition is not met.You may erase some (possibly none) 's from the string. What is the minimum number of 's that you have to erase?", "input": "The first line contains one integer  () \u2014 the number of test cases. Then  lines follow, each representing a test case. Each line contains one string  (); each character of  is either  or .", "output": "Print  integers, where the -th integer is the answer to the -th testcase (the minimum number of 's that you have to erase from ).", "tutorial": "Let's find the first and the last position of -characters (denote them as  and  respectively). Since the can't delete -characters, all -characters between  and  will remain. So, we have to delete all -characters between  and .", "solution": "for t in range(int(input())):\n    print(input().strip('0').count('0'))", "interactive": false, "noSolution": false, "noTutorial": false}
