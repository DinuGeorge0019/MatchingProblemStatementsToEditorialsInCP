Regular Bracket Sequences", "statement": "A bracket sequence is a string containing only characters \"\" and \"\". A regular bracket sequence is a bracket sequence that can be transformed into a correct arithmetic expression by inserting characters \"\" and \"\" between the original characters of the sequence. For example, bracket sequences \"\" and \"\" are regular (the resulting expressions are: \"\" and \"\"), and \"\", \"\" and \"\" are not.You are given an integer . Your goal is to construct and print  different regular bracket sequences of length .", "input": "The first line contains one integer  () \u2014 the number of test cases. Each test case consists of one line containing one integer  ().", "output": "For each test case, print  lines, each containing a regular bracket sequence of length . All bracket sequences you output for a testcase should be different (though they may repeat in different test cases). If there are multiple answers, print any of them. It can be shown that it's always possible.", "tutorial": "There are many ways to solve this problem. The model solution does the following thing:  start with the sequence ;  merge the first  characters into one sequence to get ;  merge the first  characters into one sequence to get ;  and so on.
