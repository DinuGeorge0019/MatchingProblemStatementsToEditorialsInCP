Absent Remainder", "statement": "You are given a sequence  consisting of  pairwise distinct positive integers.Find  different pairs of integers  and  such that:   ;   and  appear in ;   doesn't appear in . Note that some  or  can belong to multiple pairs. denotes the floor function\u00a0\u2014 the largest integer less than or equal to .  denotes the remainder from dividing  by .If there are multiple solutions, print any of them. It can be shown that at least one solution always exists.", "input": "The first line contains a single integer  ()\u00a0\u2014 the number of testcases. The first line of each testcase contains a single integer  ()\u00a0\u2014 the length of the sequence. The second line of each testcase contains  integers  (). All numbers in the sequence are pairwise distinct. The sum of  over all testcases doesn't exceed .", "output": "The answer for each testcase should contain  different pairs of integers  and  such that ,  and  appear in  and  doesn't appear in . Print the pairs one after another. You can print the pairs in any order. However, the order of numbers in the pair should be exactly such that the first number is  and the second number is . All pairs should be pairwise distinct. If there are multiple solutions, print any of them.", "tutorial": "There is one important observation: .Thus, you can obtain at least  pair by choosing  as the minimum number in the sequence and  as anything else.  for any positive .Overall complexity:  per testcase.", "solution": "#include <bits/stdc++.h>\n\nusing namespace std;\n\nint main() {\n  int t;\n  cin >> t;\n  while (t--) {\n    int n;\n    cin >> n;\n    vector<int> a(n);\n    for (int &x : a) cin >> x;\n    int mn = *min_element(a.begin(), a.end());\n    for (int i = 0, k = 0; k < n / 2; ++i) if (a[i] != mn) {\n      cout << a[i] << ' ' << mn << '\\n';\n      k += 1;\n    }\n  }\n}", "interactive": false, "noSolution": false, "noTutorial": false}
