Two Arrays", "statement": "You are given two integers  and . Calculate the number of pairs of arrays  such that:  the length of both arrays is equal to ;  each element of each array is an integer between  and  (inclusive);   for any index  from  to ;  array  is sorted in non-descending order;  array  is sorted in non-ascending order. As the result can be very large, you should print it modulo .", "input": "The only line contains two integers  and  (, ).", "output": "Print one integer \u2013 the number of arrays  and  satisfying the conditions described above modulo .", "tutorial": "Let's consider the following sequence:.It's sequence of length  sorted in non-descending order, where each element of each sequence is an integer between  and .We can find the number of such sequences by simple combinatorics \u2014 it's combination with repetitions. So the answer is .", "solution": "from math import factorial as fact\nmod = 10**9 + 7\n\ndef C(n, k):\n\treturn fact(n) // (fact(k) * fact(n - k))\n\nn, m = map(int, input().split())\nprint(C(n + 2*m - 1, 2*m) % mod)", "interactive": false, "noSolution": false, "noTutorial": false}
