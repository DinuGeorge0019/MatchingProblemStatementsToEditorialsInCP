Relatively Prime Pairs", "statement": "You are given a set of all integers from  to  inclusive, ,  and  is always odd.You want to split these numbers into exactly  pairs in such a way that for each pair  the greatest common divisor of  and  is equal to . Each number should appear in exactly one of the pairs.Print the resulting pairs or output that no solution exists. If there are multiple solutions, print any of them.", "input": "The only line contains two integers  and  (, ,  is odd).", "output": "If any solution exists, print \"\" in the first line.
