Shovels and Swords", "statement": "Polycarp plays a well-known computer game (we won't mention its name). In this game, he can craft tools of two types \u2014 shovels and swords. To craft a shovel, Polycarp spends two sticks and one diamond; to craft a sword, Polycarp spends two diamonds and one stick.Each tool can be sold for exactly one emerald. How many emeralds can Polycarp earn, if he has  sticks and  diamonds?", "input": "The first line contains one integer  () \u2014 the number of test cases. The only line of each test case contains two integers  and  ()\u00a0\u2014 the number of sticks and the number of diamonds, respectively.", "output": "For each test case print one integer \u2014 the maximum number of emeralds Polycarp can earn.", "tutorial": "There are three constraints on the number of emeralds:  the number of emeralds can't be greater than ;  the number of emeralds can't be greater than ;  the number of emeralds can't be greater than .
