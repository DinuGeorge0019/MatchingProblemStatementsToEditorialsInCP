Binary Protocol", "statement": "Polycarp has just invented a new binary protocol for data transmission. He is encoding positive integer decimal number to binary string using following algorithm:  Each digit is represented with number of  characters equal to the value of that digit (for  it is zero ones).  Digits are written one by one in order corresponding to number and separated by single  character. Though Polycarp learnt how to encode the numbers, he has no idea how to decode them back. Help him calculate the decoded number.", "input": "The first line contains one integer number  () \u2014 length of the string . The second line contains string  \u2014 sequence of  and  characters, number in its encoded format. It is guaranteed that the number corresponding to the string is positive and doesn't exceed . The string always starts with .", "output": "Print the decoded number.", "tutorial": "Let's decode the number digit by digit starting from the leftmost. When you meet  in the string, increase the value of the current digit. For  print current digit and proceed to the next one. Don't forget to print the last digit when the string is over.Overall complexity: .", "solution": "#ifdef __GNUC__\n#pragma GCC target(\"sse4,avx\")\n#endif\n#include <immintrin.h>\n#include <algorithm>\n#include <string>\n#include <iostream>\n#include <vector>\n#include <cstdint>\n#include <numeric>\n\nvoid run(std::istream &in, std::ostream &out) {\n    int n;\n    in >> n;\n    std::string s;\n    in >> s;\n    s.push_back('0');\n    int res = 0;\n    int cur = 0;\n    for (size_t i = 0; i < s.length(); i++) {\n        if (s[i] == '1') {\n            cur++;\n        } else {\n            res = 10 * res + cur;\n            cur = 0;\n        }\n    }\n    out << res << std::endl;\n}\n\nint main() {\n  std::cin.sync_with_stdio(false);\n  std::cin.tie(nullptr);\n  run(std::cin, std::cout);\n  return 0;\n}", "interactive": false, "noSolution": false, "noTutorial": false}
