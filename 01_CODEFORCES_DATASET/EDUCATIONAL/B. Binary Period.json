Binary Period", "statement": "Let's say string  has period  if  for all  from  to  ( means length of string ) and  is the minimum positive integer with this property.Some examples of a period: for =\"\" the period is , for =\"\" the period is , for =\"\" the period is , for =\"\" the period is .You are given string  consisting only of 's and 's and you need to find such string  that:  String  consists only of 's and 's;  The length of  doesn't exceed ;  String  is a subsequence of string ;  String  has smallest possible period among all strings that meet conditions 1\u20143. Let us recall that  is a subsequence of  if  can be derived from  by deleting zero or more elements (any) without changing the order of the remaining elements. For example, =\"\" is a subsequence of =\"\".", "input": "The first line contains single integer  ()\u00a0\u2014 the number of test cases. Next  lines contain test cases \u2014 one per line. Each line contains string  () consisting only of 's and 's.", "output": "Print one string for each test case \u2014 string  you needed to find. If there are multiple solutions print any one of them.", "tutorial": "Let's see how strings with periods $$$k = 1$$$ and $$$k = 2$$$ look. There are two types of strings with a period equal to $$$1$$$:  and . And there are two types of strings with a period equal to $$$2$$$:  and .It's easy to see if $$$t$$$ consists only of 's ('s) then the string itself is an answer since it has period equal to $$$1$$$. Otherwise, it's also quite obvious that any string $$$t$$$ is a subsequence of  () of $$$2|t|$$$ length.", "solution": "fun main() {\n    val T = readLine()!!.toInt()\n    for (tc in 1..T) {\n        val t = readLine()!!\n\n        val s = t.toCharArray().distinct().joinToString(\"\").repeat(t.length)\n        println(s)\n    }\n}", "interactive": false, "noSolution": false, "noTutorial": false}
