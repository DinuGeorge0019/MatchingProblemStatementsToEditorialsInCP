Sum of Odd Integers", "statement": "You are given two integers  and . Your task is to find if  can be represented as a sum of   (not divisible by ) integers or not.You have to answer  independent test cases.", "input": "The first line of the input contains one integer  () \u2014 the number of test cases. The next  lines describe test cases. The only line of the test case contains two integers  and  ().", "output": "For each test case, print the answer \u2014 \"\" (without quotes) if  can be represented as a sum of   (not divisible by ) integers and \"\" otherwise.", "tutorial": "First of all, notice that the sum of the first  odd integers is . If  then the answer obviously \"\". And if  then the answer is \"\" also ( is modulo operation). Otherwise, the answer is always \"\" and it seems like this: , where . It is obviously greater than  because  and it is obviously odd because the parity of  and  is the same.", "solution": "for i in range(int(input())):\n    n, k = map(int, input().split())\n    print('YES' if k * k <= n and n % 2 == k % 2 else 'NO')", "interactive": false, "noSolution": false, "noTutorial": false}
