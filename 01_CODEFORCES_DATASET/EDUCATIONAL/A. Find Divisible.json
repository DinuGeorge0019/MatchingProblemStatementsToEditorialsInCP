Find Divisible", "statement": "You are given a range of positive integers from  to .Find such a pair of integers  that ,  and  divides .If there are multiple answers, print any of them.You are also asked to answer  independent queries.", "input": "The first line contains a single integer  () \u2014 the number of queries. Each of the next  lines contains two integers  and  () \u2014 inclusive borders of the range. It is guaranteed that testset only includes queries, which have at least one suitable pair.", "output": "Print  lines, each line should contain the answer \u2014 two integers  and  such that ,  and  divides . The answer in the -th line should correspond to the -th query from the input. If there are multiple answers, print any of them.", "tutorial": "Print  and . Firstly, the smallest value of  you can have is  and if any greater value fits then  fits as well. Secondly, the absolute difference between  and  increases when you increase , thus lessening the possibility of both numbers fitting into the range.Overall complexity: .", "solution": "T = int(input())\nfor i in range(T):\n\tl, r = map(int, input().split())\n\tprint(l, l * 2)", "interactive": false, "noSolution": false, "noTutorial": false}
