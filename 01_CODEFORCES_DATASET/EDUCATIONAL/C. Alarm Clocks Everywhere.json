Alarm Clocks Everywhere", "statement": "Ivan is going to sleep now and wants to set his alarm clock. There will be many necessary events tomorrow, the -th of them will start during the -th minute. Ivan doesn't want to skip any of the events, so he has to set his alarm clock in such a way that it rings during minutes , so he will be awake during each of these minutes ().Ivan can choose two properties for the alarm clock \u2014 the first minute it will ring (let's denote it as ) and the interval between two consecutive signals (let's denote it by ). After the clock is set, it will ring during minutes  and so on.Ivan can choose  minute as the first one, but he cannot choose any arbitrary value of . He has to pick it among the given values  (his phone does not support any other options for this setting).So Ivan has to choose the first minute  when the alarm clock should start ringing and the interval between two consecutive signals  in such a way that it will ring during all given minutes  (and it does not matter if his alarm clock will ring in any other minutes).Your task is to tell the first minute  and the index  such that if Ivan sets his alarm clock with properties  and  it will ring during all given minutes  or say that it is impossible to choose such values of the given properties. If there are multiple answers, you can print any.", "input": "The first line of the input contains two integers  and  () \u2014 the number of events and the number of possible settings for the interval between signals. The second line of the input contains  integers  (), where  is the minute when -th event starts. It is guaranteed that all  are given in increasing order (i.\u2009e. the condition  holds). The third line of the input contains  integers  (), where  is the -th option for the interval between two consecutive signals.", "output": "If it's impossible to choose such values  and  so all constraints are satisfied, print \"\" in the first line. Otherwise print \"\" in the first line. Then print two integers  () and  () in the second line, where  is the first minute Ivan's alarm clock should start ringing and  is the index of the option for the interval between two consecutive signals (options are numbered from  to  in the order they are given input). These values should be chosen in such a way that the alarm clock will ring during all given minutes . If there are multiple answers, you can print any.", "tutorial": "It is obvious that we can always take  as . But we don't know which value of  we can take. Let  be  for all  from  to . The value of  should be divisor of  value of . The maximum possible divisor of each  is  (greatest common divisor). And then it is obvious that the value of  should be the divisor of . So we have to find  divisor of  among all values .
