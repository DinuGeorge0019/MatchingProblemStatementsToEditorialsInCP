Digital root", "statement": "Today at the lesson of mathematics, Petya learns about the digital root.The digital root of a non-negative integer is the single digit value obtained by an iterative process of summing digits, on each iteration using the result from the previous iteration to compute a digit sum. The process continues until a single-digit number is reached. Let's denote the digital root of  as . Then , , .As a homework Petya got  tasks of the form: find -th positive number whose digital root is .Petya has already solved all the problems, but he doesn't know if it's right. Your task is to solve all  tasks from Petya's homework.", "input": "The first line contains a single integer  () \u2014 the number of tasks in Petya's homework. The next  lines contain two integers  () and  () \u2014 -th Petya's task in which you need to find a -th positive number, the digital root of which is .", "output": "Output  lines, -th line should contain a single integer \u2014 the answer to the -th problem.", "tutorial": "The key observation is that the digital root of an integer  is the single-digit number  such that . You can prove this by noticing that  for all . Once we observe this, finding the -th number is very simple; see the code: 48993705\n", "solution": "#include <algorithm>\n#include <cassert>\n#include <iostream>\n#include <vector>\nusing namespace std;\n\nint main() {\n    ios::sync_with_stdio(false);\n    cin.tie(nullptr);\n\n    int N;\n    cin >> N;\n\n    while (N-- > 0) {\n        long long K;\n        int X;\n        cin >> K >> X;\n        cout << 9 * (K - 1) + X << '\\n';\n    }\n}\n", "interactive": false, "noSolution": false, "noTutorial": false}
