Poisoned Dagger", "statement": "Monocarp is playing yet another computer game. In this game, his character has to kill a dragon. The battle with the dragon lasts  seconds, during which Monocarp attacks the dragon with a poisoned dagger. The -th attack is performed at the beginning of the -th second from the battle start. The dagger itself does not deal damage, but it applies a poison effect on the dragon, which deals  damage during each of the next  seconds (starting with the same second when the dragon was stabbed by the dagger). However, if the dragon has already been poisoned, then the dagger updates the poison effect (i.e. cancels the current poison effect and applies a new one).For example, suppose , and Monocarp stabs the dragon during the seconds ,  and . Then the poison effect is applied at the start of the -nd second and deals  damage during the -nd and -rd seconds; then, at the beginning of the -th second, the poison effect is reapplied, so it deals exactly  damage during the seconds , ,  and ; then, during the -th second, the poison effect is applied again, and it deals  damage during the seconds , ,  and . In total, the dragon receives  damage.Monocarp knows that the dragon has  hit points, and if he deals at least  damage to the dragon during the battle \u2014 he slays the dragon. Monocarp has not decided on the strength of the poison he will use during the battle, so he wants to find the minimum possible value of  (the number of seconds the poison effect lasts) that is enough to deal at least  damage to the dragon.", "input": "The first line contains a single integer  ()\u00a0\u2014 the number of test cases. The first line of the test case contains two integers  and  ()\u00a0\u2014 the number of Monocarp's attacks and the amount of damage that needs to be dealt. The second line contains  integers , , ...,  (), where  is the second when the -th attack is performed.", "output": "For each test case, print a single integer\u00a0\u2014 the minimum value of the parameter , such that Monocarp will cause at least  damage to the dragon.", "tutorial": "Let's find out the total damage for a fixed value of . Since the effect of the poison from the -th attack deals damage  seconds for  and  seconds for , then the total damage is . We can see that the higher the value of , the greater the total sum. So we can do a binary search on  and find the minimum value when the sum is greater than or equal to .", "solution": "#include <bits/stdc++.h>\n\nusing namespace std;\n\nusing li = long long;\n\nint main() {\n  int t;\n  cin >> t;\n  while (t--) {\n    int n;\n    li h;\n    cin >> n >> h;\n    vector<li> a(n);\n    for (li &x : a) cin >> x;\n    li l = 1, r = 1e18;\n    while (l <= r) {\n      li m = (l + r) / 2;\n      li sum = m;\n      for (int i = 0; i < n - 1; ++i) \n        sum += min(m, a[i + 1] - a[i]);\n      if (sum < h) l = m + 1;\n      else r = m - 1;\n    }\n    cout << r + 1 << '\\n';\n  }\n}", "interactive": false, "noSolution": false, "noTutorial": false}
