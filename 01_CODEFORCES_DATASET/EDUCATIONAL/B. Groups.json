Groups", "statement": " students attended the first meeting of the Berland SU programming course ( is even). All students will be divided into two groups. Each group will be attending exactly one lesson each week during one of the five working days (Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday and Friday), and the days chosen for the groups must be different. Furthermore, both groups should contain the same number of students.Each student has filled a survey in which they told which days of the week are convenient for them to attend a lesson, and which are not. Your task is to determine if it is possible to choose two different week days to schedule the lessons for the group (the first group will attend the lesson on the first chosen day, the second group will attend the lesson on the second chosen day), and divide the students into two groups, so the groups have equal sizes, and for each student, the chosen lesson day for their group is convenient.", "input": "The first line contains a single integer  ()\u00a0\u2014 the number of testcases. Then the descriptions of  testcases follow. The first line of each testcase contains one integer  ()\u00a0\u2014 the number of students. The -th of the next  lines contains  integers, each of them is  or . If the -th integer is , then the -th student can attend the lessons on the -th day of the week. If the -th integer is , then the -th student cannot attend the lessons on the -th day of the week.  Additional constraints on the input: for each student, at least one of the days of the week is convenient, the total number of students over all testcases doesn't exceed .", "output": "For each testcase print an answer. If it's possible to divide the students into two groups of equal sizes and choose different days for the groups so each student can attend the lesson in the chosen day of their group, print \"\" (without quotes). Otherwise, print \"\" (without quotes). ", "tutorial": "Since there are only five days, we can iterate over the two of them that will be the answer.Now we have fixed a pair of days  and  and want to check if it can be the answer.All students can be divided into four groups: marked neither of days  and , marked only day , marked only day  and marked both days.Obviously, if the first group is non-empty, days  and  can't be the answer.Let's call the number of students, who only marked day ,  and the number of students, who only marked day , .If either of  or  exceed , then days  and  can't be the answer as well. Otherwise, we can always choose  students from the ones who marked both days and send them to day . The rest of the students can go to day .", "solution": "t = int(input())\nfor i in range(t):\n    n = int(input())\n    a = [[] for i in range(n)]\n    for j in range(n):\n        a[j] = list(map(int, input().split()))\n    ans = False\n    for j in range(5):\n        for k in range(5):\n            if k != j:\n                cnt1 = 0\n                cnt2 = 0\n                cntno = 0\n                for z in range(n):\n                    if a[z][j] == 1:\n                        cnt1 += 1\n                    if a[z][k] == 1:\n                        cnt2 += 1\n                    if a[z][j] == 0 and a[z][k] == 0:\n                        cntno += 1\n                if cnt1 >= n // 2 and cnt2 >= n // 2 and cntno == 0:\n                    ans = True\n    if ans:\n        print('YES')\n    else:\n        print('NO')", "interactive": false, "noSolution": false, "noTutorial": false}
