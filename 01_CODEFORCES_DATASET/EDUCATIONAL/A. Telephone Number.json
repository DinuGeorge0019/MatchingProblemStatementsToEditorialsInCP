Telephone Number", "statement": "A telephone number is a sequence of exactly  digits, where the first digit is . For example, the sequence  is a telephone number, but the sequences  and  are not.You are given a string  of length , consisting of digits.In one operation you can delete any character from string . For example, it is possible to obtain strings ,  or  from string .You need to determine whether there is such a sequence of operations (possibly empty), after which the string  becomes a telephone number.", "input": "The first line contains one integer  () \u2014 the number of test cases. The first line of each test case contains one integer  () \u2014 the length of string . The second line of each test case contains the string  () consisting of digits.", "output": "For each test print one line. If there is a sequence of operations, after which  becomes a telephone number, print . Otherwise, print .", "tutorial": "To solve this problem, we just need to find the first occurrence of the digit , let's denote it as .
