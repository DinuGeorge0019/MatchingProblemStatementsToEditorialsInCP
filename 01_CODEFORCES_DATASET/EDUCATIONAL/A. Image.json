Image", "statement": "You have an image file of size , consisting of  pixels. Each pixel can have one of  different colors, denoted by lowercase Latin letters.You want to recolor some of the pixels of the image . In one move, you can choose  pixels  and paint them into some other color .What is the minimum number of moves you have to make in order to fulfill your goal?", "input": "The first line contains one integer  () \u2014 the number of test cases. Each test case consists of two lines. Each of these lines contains two lowercase letters of Latin alphabet , denoting a row of pixels in the image.", "output": "For each test case, print one integer \u2014 the minimum number of moves you have to make so that all  pixels of the image have the same color.", "tutorial": "There are some solutions based on case analysis, but in my opinion, the most elegant one is the following:Let's pick a color with the maximum possible number of pixels and repaint all other pixels into it. We will try to pick all pixels of some other color and repaint them in one operation, and we can ignore the constraint that we can repaint no more than  pixels, since we will never need to repaint  or  pixels in one operation. So, the number of operations is just the number of colors other than the one we chosen, or just , where  is the number of different colors in the image. To calculate this, we can use a set or an array of size , where we mark which colors are present.", "solution": "#include<bits/stdc++.h>\n\nusing namespace std;\n\nint main()\n{\n    int t;\n    cin >> t;\n    for(int i = 0; i < t; i++)\n    {\n        string s1, s2;\n        cin >> s1 >> s2;\n        s1 += s2;\n        cout << set<char>(s1.begin(), s1.end()).size() - 1 << endl;\n    }\n}", "interactive": false, "noSolution": false, "noTutorial": false}
