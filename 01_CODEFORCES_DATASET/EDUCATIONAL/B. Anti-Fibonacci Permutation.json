Anti-Fibonacci Permutation", "statement": "Let's call a permutation  of length   if the condition  holds for all  (). Recall that the permutation is the array of length  which contains each integer from  to  exactly once.Your task is for a given number  print   anti-Fibonacci permutations of length .", "input": "The first line contains a single integer  ()\u00a0\u2014 the number of test cases.  The single line of each test case contains a single integer  ().", "output": "For each test case, print  lines. Each line should contain an anti-Fibonacci permutation of length . In each test case, you cannot print any permutation more than once. If there are multiple answers, print any of them. It can be shown that it is always possible to find  different anti-Fibonacci permutations of size  under the constraints of the problem.", "tutorial": "Let's consider one of the possible solutions. Let's put the first element in the -th permutation equal to , and sort all the other elements in descending order. Thus, we get permutations of the form: , , ..., . In such a construction  for all  (), and hence .", "solution": "#include <bits/stdc++.h>\n\nusing namespace std;\n\nint main() {\n\tint t;\n\tcin >> t;\n\twhile (t--) {\n\t\tint n;\n\t\tcin >> n;\n\t\tfor (int i = 1; i <= n; ++i) {\n\t\t\tcout << i;\n\t\t\tfor (int j = n; j > 0; --j) if (i != j)\n\t\t\t\tcout << ' ' << j;\n\t\t\tcout << '\\n';\n\t\t}\n\t}\n}", "interactive": false, "noSolution": false, "noTutorial": false}
