K-divisible Sum", "statement": "You are given two integers  and .You should create an array of    such that the sum  is divisible by  and maximum element in  is minimum possible.What is the minimum possible maximum element in ?", "input": "The first line contains a single integer  ()\u00a0\u2014 the number of test cases. The first and only line of each test case contains two integers  and  (; ).", "output": "For each test case, print one integer\u00a0\u2014 the minimum possible maximum element in array  such that the sum  is divisible by . ", "tutorial": "Let's denote  as the sum of array . From one side, since  should be divisible by  then we can say . From other side, since all  are positive, then .It's quite obvious that the smaller \u00a0\u2014 the smaller maximum  so we need to find the smallest  that . Then .Now we now that  and we need to represent it as  with maximum  minimized. It's easy to prove by contradiction that maximum .Moreover we can always construct such array  that its sum is equal to  and the maximum element is equal to .As a result, the answer is , where .", "solution": "#include<bits/stdc++.h>\n\nusing namespace std;\n\nint main() {\n  int t; cin >> t;\n  while(t--) {\n    long long n, k;\n    cin >> n >> k;\n    \n    long long cf = (n + k - 1) / k;\n    k *= cf;\n    \n    cout << (k + n - 1) / n << endl;\n  }\n  return 0;\n}", "interactive": false, "noSolution": false, "noTutorial": false}
