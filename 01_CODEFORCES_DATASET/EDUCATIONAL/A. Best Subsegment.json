Find the subsegment  () with maximum arithmetic mean  (in floating-point numbers, i.e. without any rounding).If there are many such subsegments find the  one.", "input": "The first line contains single integer  () \u2014 length of the array . The second line contains  integers  () \u2014 the array .", "output": "Print the single integer \u2014 the length of the longest subsegment with maximum possible arithmetic mean.", "tutorial": "There is a property of arithmetic mean:  and the equality holds when . Obviously, we can always gain maximum arithmetic mean equal to  by taking single maximum element from . Considering the property above, we need to take only maximum elements in our subsegment, that's why we need to find the longest subsegment consisting only of maximum elements.", "solution": "#include<iostream>\nusing namespace std;\n\nint main() {\n\tint n; cin >> n;\n\tint mx = -1, lenMx = 0;\n\t\n\tint curEl = -1, curLen = 0;\n\tfor(int i = 0; i < n; i++) {\n\t\tint a; cin >> a;\n\t\t\n\t\tif(curEl != a)\n\t\t\tcurEl = a, curLen = 0;\n\t\tcurLen++;\n\t\t\n\t\tif(mx < curEl)\n\t\t\tmx = curEl, lenMx = 0;\n\t\tif(mx == curEl)\n\t\t\tlenMx = max(lenMx, curLen);\n\t}\n\tcout << lenMx << endl;\n\treturn 0;\n}", "interactive": false, "noSolution": false, "noTutorial": false}
