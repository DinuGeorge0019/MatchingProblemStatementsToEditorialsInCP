It has integer numbers from  to  written on its faces (all numbers on faces are different, so this is an  usual dice).Mishka wants to get exactly  points by rolling his dice. The number of points is just a sum of numbers written at the topmost face of the dice for all the rolls Mishka makes.Mishka doesn't really care about the number of rolls, so he just wants to know  number of rolls he can make to be able to get exactly  points for them.  Your task is to print this number. It is  that at least one answer exists.Mishka is also very curious about different number of points to score so you have to answer   queries.", "input": "The first line of the input contains one integer  () \u2014 the number of queries. Each of the next  lines contains one integer each. The -th line contains one integer  () \u2014 the number of points Mishka wants to get.", "output": "Print  lines. In the -th line print the answer to the -th query (i.e.  number of rolls Mishka can make to be able to get exactly  points for them). It is  that at least one answer exists.", "tutorial": "It is enough to print  for each query, where  is  divided by  rounded down.", "solution": "#include <bits/stdc++.h>\n\nusing namespace std;\n\nint main() {\n\tint t;\n\tcin >> t;\n\tfor (int i = 0; i < t; ++i) {\n\t\tint x;\n\t\tcin >> x;\n\t\tcout << x / 2 << endl;\n\t}\n\treturn 0;\n}", "interactive": false, "noSolution": false, "noTutorial": false}
