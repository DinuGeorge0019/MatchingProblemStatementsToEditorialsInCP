Calendar Ambiguity", "statement": "Berland year consists of  months with  days each. Months are numbered from  to . Berland week consists of  days. The first day of the year is also the first day of the week.

Thus, the corresponding day of the week is .So we can rewrite the condition for a pair as . That's also . Continue with . So  should be divisible by .  is fixed and some prime divisors of  might have appeared in it already. If we remove them from  then  should just be divisible by the resulting number. So we can divide  by  and obtain that .Now we should just count the number of pairs  such that  is divisible by . We know that the difference  should be from  to . So we can fix the difference and add the number of pairs for that difference. That would be  for a difference . Finally, the answer is . Use the formula for the sum of arithmetic progression to solve that in .Overall complexity:  per testcase.", "solution": "fun gcd(a: Long, b: Long): Long {\n\tif (a == 0L) return b\n\treturn gcd(b % a, a)\n}\n\nfun main() {\n\trepeat(readLine()!!.toInt()) {\n\t\tval (m, d, w) = readLine()!!.split(' ').map { it.toLong() }\n\t\tval w2 = w / gcd(d - 1, w)\n\t\tval mn = minOf(m, d)\n\t\tvar cnt = mn / w2\n\t\tprintln((2 * (mn - w2) - w2 * (cnt - 1)) * cnt / 2)\n\t}\n}", "interactive": false, "noSolution": false, "noTutorial": false}
