Your goal is to reach the point . In one minute, you can move by  or by  to the left or to the right (i.\u2009e., if your current coordinate is , it can become , ,  or ). Note that the new coordinate can become negative.Your task is to find the  number of minutes required to get from the point  to the point .You have to answer  independent test cases.", "input": "The first line of the input contains one integer  () \u2014 the number of test cases. Then  lines describing the test cases follow. The -th of these lines contains one integer  () \u2014 the goal of the -th test case.", "output": "For each test case, print one integer \u2014 the  number of minutes required to get from the point  to the point  for the corresponding test case.", "tutorial": "If , the answer is  (we can't get , so we can move by  to the right and by  to the left). If  or , the answer is obviously . Otherwise, the answer is always . We can't get the answer less than this value (because we need at least  moves to get to the point greater than or equal to ) and we can always get this answer by the recurrence.", "solution": "for _ in range(int(input())):\n    n = int(input())\n    print(1 + (n == 1) if n <= 3 else (n + 2) // 3)", "interactive": false, "noSolution": false, "noTutorial": false}
