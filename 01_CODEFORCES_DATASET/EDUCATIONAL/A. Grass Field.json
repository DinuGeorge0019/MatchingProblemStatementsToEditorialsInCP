Each cell of this field can either contain grass or be empty. The value  is  if the cell  contains grass, or  otherwise.In one move, you can choose  and  and cut all the grass in this row and this column. In other words, you choose the row  and the column , then you cut the grass in all cells  and all cells  for all  from  to . After you cut the grass from a cell, it becomes empty (i.\u2009e. its value is replaced by ).Your task is to find the minimum number of moves required to cut the grass in all non-empty cells of the field (i.\u2009e. make all  zeros).You have to answer  independent test cases.", "input": "The first line of the input contains one integer  () \u2014 the number of test cases. Then  test cases follow. The test case consists of two lines, each of these lines contains two integers. The -th integer in the -th row is . If  then the cell  is empty, and if  the cell  contains grass.", "output": "For each test case, print one integer \u2014 the minimum number of moves required to cut the grass in all non-empty cells of the field (i.\u2009e. make all  zeros) in the corresponding test case.", "tutorial": "If there is no grass on the field, the answer is . If the whole field is filled with grass, the answer is , because there always will be one cell that we can't clear with one move. Otherwise, the answer is . This is because if the cell  is empty, we can just choose other row than  and other column than  and clear three other cells in one move.", "solution": "for _ in range(int(input())):\n    a = [list(map(int, input().split())) for i in range(2)]\n    cnt = sum([sum(a[i]) for i in range(2)])\n    if cnt == 0:\n        print(0)\n    elif cnt == 4:\n        print(2)\n    else:\n        print(1)", "interactive": false, "noSolution": false, "noTutorial": false}
