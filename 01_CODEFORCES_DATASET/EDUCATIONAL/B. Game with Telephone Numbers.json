Game with Telephone Numbers", "statement": "A telephone number is a sequence of   digits such that its first digit is .Vasya and Petya are playing a game. Initially they have a string  of length  ( is odd) consisting of digits. Vasya makes the first move, then players alternate turns. In one move the player  choose a character and erase it from the current string. For example, if the current string , after the player's move it may be ,  or . The game ends when the length of string  becomes . If the resulting string is a telephone number, Vasya wins, otherwise Petya wins.You have to determine if Vasya has a winning strategy (that is, if Vasya can win the game no matter which characters Petya chooses during his moves).", "input": "The first line contains one integer  (,  is odd) \u2014 the length of string . The second line contains the string  () consisting only of decimal digits.", "output": "If Vasya has a strategy that guarantees him victory, print . Otherwise print .", "tutorial": "Let's understand how players should act. Vasya needs to delete the first digit that is not equal to , because the first digit of telephone number should be , and the first digit not equal to  is preventing it.Petya needs to delete the first digit equal to , for the same reasons.So, all that we need to do is delete first  digits not equal to  (if they exist), and first  digits equal to  (again if they exist). It's enough to stop when there is either no 's left or no non-'s because the latter moves won't change the result of the game anyway. Finally, if first digit of resulting string is , then Vasya wins, otherwise Petya.Overall complexity: .", "solution": "#include<bits/stdc++.h>\n\nusing namespace std;\n\nint n;\nstring s;\n\nint main(){\n    cin >> n >> s;\n    int cnt1 = (n - 11) / 2;\n    int cnt2 = cnt1;\n    string res = \"\";\n    for(int i = 0; i < n; ++i){\n        if(s[i] == '8'){\n            if(cnt1 > 0) --cnt1;\n            else res += s[i];\n        }\n        else{\n            if(cnt2 > 0) --cnt2;\n            else res += s[i];\n        }\n    }\n    \n    if(res[0] == '8') cout << \"YES\\n\";\n    else cout << \"NO\\n\";\n\treturn 0;\n}", "interactive": false, "noSolution": false, "noTutorial": false}
