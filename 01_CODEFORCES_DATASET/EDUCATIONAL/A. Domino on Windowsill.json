Domino on Windowsill", "statement": "You have a board represented as a grid with  cells.The first  cells on the first row and first  cells on the second row are colored in white. All other cells are colored in black.You have  white dominoes ( tiles, both cells are colored in white) and  black dominoes ( tiles, both cells are colored in black).You can place a white domino on the board if both board's cells are white and not occupied by any other domino. In the same way, you can place a black domino if both cells are black and not occupied by any other domino.Can you place all  dominoes on the board if you can place dominoes both horizontally and vertically?", "input": "The first line contains a single integer  ()\u00a0\u2014 the number of test cases. The first line of each test case contains three integers ,  and  (; ). The second line of each test case contains two integers  and  ().", "output": "For each test case, print  if it's possible to place all  dominoes on the board and , otherwise. You may print every letter in any case you want (so, for example, the strings , ,  and  are all recognized as positive answer).", "tutorial": "We can prove that if we have  white cells on the board then we can place any  white dominoes as long as .The proof is the following: if  let's place one domino at position , otherwise let's place domino at position . Then we can solve the placement of  dominoes in  cells in the first row and  cells of the second row recursively (or, analogically,  and ).At the end, either all dominoes are placed or  and . If  or  then, since , then  or we successfully placed all dominoes. If  and  then we, possibly, need to place one domino more\u00a0\u2014 and we can place it vertically.We can prove that we can place any  dominoes as long as  in the same manner.As a result, all we need to check is that  and .", "solution": "fun main() {\n    repeat(readLine()!!.toInt()) {\n        val (n, k1, k2) = readLine()!!.split(' ').map { it.toInt() }\n        val (w, b) = readLine()!!.split(' ').map { it.toInt() }\n\n        if (k1 + k2 >= 2 * w && (n - k1) + (n - k2) >= 2 * b)\n            println(\"YES\")\n        else\n            println(\"NO\")\n    }\n}", "interactive": false, "noSolution": false, "noTutorial": false}
