Remove a Progression", "statement": "You have a list of numbers from  to  written from left to right on the blackboard.You perform an algorithm consisting of several steps (steps are -indexed). On the -th step you wipe the -th number (considering only  numbers). You wipe  (not one digit).  When there are less than  numbers remaining, you stop your algorithm. Now you wonder: what is the value of the -th remaining number after the algorithm is stopped?", "input": "The first line contains one integer  () \u2014 the number of queries. The next  lines contain queries \u2014 one per line. All queries are independent. Each line contains two space-separated integers  and  () \u2014 the length of the list and the position we wonder about. It's guaranteed that after the algorithm ends, the list will still contain at least  numbers.", "output": "Print  integers (one per query) \u2014 the values of the -th number after performing the algorithm for the corresponding queries.", "tutorial": "After some simulation of the given algorithm (in your head, on paper or on a computer) we can realize that exactly all odd numbers are erased. So, all even numbers remain, and the answer is .", "solution": "fun main(args: Array<String>) {\n    val T = readLine()!!.toInt()\n    for (t in 1..T) {\n        val (n, x) = readLine()!!.split(' ').map { it.toLong() }\n        println(x * 2)\n    }\n}", "interactive": false, "noSolution": false, "noTutorial": false}
