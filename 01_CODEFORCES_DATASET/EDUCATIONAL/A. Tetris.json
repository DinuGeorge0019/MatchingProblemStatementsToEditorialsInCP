There is a platform with  columns.  squares are appearing one after another in some columns on this platform. If there are no squares in the column, a square will occupy the bottom row. Otherwise a square will appear at the top of the highest square of this column. When all of the  columns have at least one square in them, the bottom row is being removed. You will receive  point for this, and all the squares left will fall down one row. You task is to calculate the amount of points you will receive.", "input": "The first line of input contain 2 integer numbers  and  () \u2014 the length of the platform and the number of the squares.
