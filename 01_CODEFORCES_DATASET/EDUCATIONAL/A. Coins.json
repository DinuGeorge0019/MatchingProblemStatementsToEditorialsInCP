Coins", "statement": "In Berland, there are two types of coins, having denominations of  and  burles.Your task is to determine whether it is possible to represent  burles in coins, i.\u2009e. whether there exist non-negative integers  and  such that .", "input": "The first line contains a single integer  ()\u00a0\u2014 the number of test cases. The only line of each test case contains two integers  and  (; ).", "output": "For each test case, print  if it is possible to represent  burles in coins; otherwise, print . You may print each letter in any case (, ,  will all be recognized as positive answer, ,  and  will all be recognized as negative answer).", "tutorial": "Note that $$$2$$$ coins with denomination $$$k$$$ can be replaced with $$$k$$$ coins with denomination $$$2$$$. So, if the answer exists, then there is also such a set of coins, where there is no more than one coin with denomination $$$k$$$. Therefore, it is enough to iterate through the number of coins with denomination $$$k$$$ (from $$$0$$$ to $$$1$$$) and check that the remaining number is non-negative and even (i.\u2009e. it can be represented as some number of coins with denomination $$$2$$$).", "solution": "for _ in range(int(input())):\n\tn, k = map(int, input().split())\n\tfor x in range(2):\n\t\tif n - x * k >= 0 and (n - x * k) % 2 == 0:\n\t\t\tprint(\"YES\")\n\t\t\tbreak\n\telse:\n\t\tprint(\"NO\")", "interactive": false, "noSolution": false, "noTutorial": false}
