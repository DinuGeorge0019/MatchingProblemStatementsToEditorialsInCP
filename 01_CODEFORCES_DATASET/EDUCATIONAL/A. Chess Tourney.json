Chess Tourney", "statement": "Berland annual chess tournament is coming!Organizers have gathered  chess players who should be divided into two teams with  people each. The first team is sponsored by BerOil and the second team is sponsored by BerMobile. Obviously, organizers should guarantee the win for the team of BerOil.Thus, organizers should divide all  players into two teams with  people each in such a way that the first team always wins.Every chess player has its rating . It is known that chess player with the greater rating always wins the player with the lower rating. If their ratings are equal then any of the players can win.After teams assignment there will come a drawing to form  pairs of opponents: in each pair there is a player from the first team and a player from the second team. Every chess player should be in exactly one pair. Every pair plays once. The drawing is totally random.Is it possible to divide all  players into two teams with  people each so that the player from the first team in every pair wins  of the results of the drawing?", "input": "The first line contains one integer  (). The second line contains  integers  ().", "output": "If it's possible to divide all  players into two teams with  people each so that the player from the first team in every pair wins regardless of the results of the drawing, then print . Otherwise print .", "tutorial": "Let's sort the input array in non-decreasing order. Now we should take the first  players to the first team and the last  players \u2014 to the second team. That will guarantee that every member of the first team has greater or equal rating than every member of the second team. Now the only thing left is to check if all ratings in the first teams differ from all the ratings in the second team (if some are equal then  in sorted order).", "solution": "//package educational.round27;\nimport java.io.ByteArrayInputStream;\nimport java.io.IOException;\nimport java.io.InputStream;\nimport java.io.PrintWriter;\nimport java.util.Arrays;\nimport java.util.InputMismatchException;\n\npublic class A {\n\tInputStream is;\n\tPrintWriter out;\n\tString INPUT = \"\";\n\t\n\tvoid solve()\n\t{\n\t\tint n = ni();\n\t\tint[] a = na(2*n);\n\t\tArrays.sort(a);\n\t\tout.println(a[n-1] < a[n] ? \"YES\" : \"NO\");\n\t}\n\t\n\tvoid run() throws Exception\n\t{\n\t\tis = oj ?
