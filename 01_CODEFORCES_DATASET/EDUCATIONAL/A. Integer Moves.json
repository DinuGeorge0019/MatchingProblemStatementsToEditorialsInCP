Integer Moves", "statement": "There's a chip in the point  of the coordinate plane. In one operation, you can move the chip from some point  to some point  if the Euclidean distance between these two points is an  (i.e.  is integer).Your task is to determine the minimum number of operations required to move the chip from the point  to the point .", "input": "The first line contains a single integer  ()\u00a0\u2014 number of test cases. The single line of each test case contains two integers  and  ()\u00a0\u2014 the coordinates of the destination point.", "output": "For each test case, print one integer\u00a0\u2014 the minimum number of operations required to move the chip from the point  to the point .", "tutorial": "Note that the answer does not exceed , because the chip can be moved as follows: . Obviously, in this case, both operation are valid. It remains to check the cases when the answer is  or . The answer is  only if the destination point is , and the answer is  if  is integer.", "solution": "#include <bits/stdc++.h>\n\nusing namespace std;\n\nint main() {\n  int t;\n  cin >> t;\n  while (t--) {\n    int x, y;\n    cin >> x >> y;\n    int d = x * x + y * y;\n    int r = 0;\n    while (r * r < d) ++r;\n    int ans = 2;\n    if (r * r == d) ans = 1;\n    if (x == 0 && y == 0) ans = 0; \n    cout << ans << '\\n';\n  }\n}", "interactive": false, "noSolution": false, "noTutorial": false}
