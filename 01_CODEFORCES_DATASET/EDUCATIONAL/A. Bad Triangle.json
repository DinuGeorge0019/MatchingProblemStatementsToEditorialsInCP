Bad Triangle", "statement": "You are given an array , which is sorted in non-decreasing order (. Find three indices , ,  such that  and it is  to construct a non-degenerate triangle (a triangle with nonzero area) having sides equal to ,  and  (for example it is possible to construct a non-degenerate triangle with sides ,  and  but impossible with sides ,  and ). If it is impossible to find such triple, report it.", "input": "The first line contains one integer  ()\u00a0\u2014 the number of test cases. The first line of each test case contains one integer  ()\u00a0\u2014 the length of the array . The second line of each test case contains  integers  (; )\u00a0\u2014 the array . It is guaranteed that the sum of  over all test cases does not exceed .", "output": "For each test case print the answer to it in one line. If there is a triple of indices , ,  () such that it is  to construct a non-degenerate triangle having sides equal to ,  and , print that three indices in ascending order. If there are multiple answers, print any of them. Otherwise, print .", "tutorial": "The triangle with side  is degenerate if . So we have to maximize the length of the longest side () and minimize the total length of other sides ().Thus, if  then we answer if , otherwise the answer is .", "solution": "for _ in range(int(input())):\n    n = int(input())\n    a = list(map(int, input().split()))\n    if a[0] + a[1] > a[-1]:\n        print(-1)\n    else:\n        print(1, 2, n)", "interactive": false, "noSolution": false, "noTutorial": false}
