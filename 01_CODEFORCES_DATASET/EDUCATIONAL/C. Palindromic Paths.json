Palindromic Paths", "statement": "You are given a matrix with  rows (numbered from  to ) and  columns (numbered from  to ). A number  is written in the cell belonging to the -th row and the -th column, each number is either  or .A chip is initially in the cell , and it will be moved to the cell . During each move, it either moves to the next cell in the current row, or in the current column (if the current cell is , then after the move it can be either  or ). The chip cannot leave the matrix.Consider each path of the chip from  to . A path is called  if the number in the first cell is equal to the number in the last cell, the number in the second cell is equal to the number in the second-to-last cell, and so on.Your goal is to change the values in the minimum number of cells so that  path is .", "input": "The first line contains one integer  () \u2014 the number of test cases. The first line of each test case contains two integers  and  () \u2014 the dimensions of the matrix. Then  lines follow, the -th line contains  integers , , ...,  ().", "output": "For each test case, print one integer \u2014 the minimum number of cells you have to change so that every path in the matrix is palindromic.", "tutorial": "Let's group the cells by their distance from the starting point: the group  consists of a single cell ; the group  consists of the cells  and , and so on. In total, there are  groups.Let's analyze the groups  and . There are two cases:  if  or , then we are looking at the starting cell and the ending cell, and their contents should be equal;  otherwise, suppose two cells  and  belong to the same group. We can easily prove that the contents of these two cells should be equal (for example, by analyzing two paths that go through cell  and coincide after this cell, but one goes to  from , and another \u2014 from ) \u2014 and, using induction, we can prove that the contents of all cells in a group should be equal. And since the paths should be palindromic, the contents of the group  should be equal to the contents of the group . So, in each pair of groups, we should calculate the number of 's and 's, and choose which of them to change. Note that if  is even, the central group has no pair, so it should not be modified.", "solution": "#include <bits/stdc++.h>\n\nusing namespace std;\n\nvoid solve()\n{\n\tint n, m;\n\tcin >> n >> m;\n\tvector<vector<int> > a(n, vector<int>(m));\n\tfor(int i = 0; i < n; i++)\n\t\tfor(int j = 0; j < m; j++)\n\t\t\tcin >> a[i][j];\n\tvector<vector<int> > cnt(n + m - 1, vector<int>(2));\n\tfor(int i = 0; i < n; i++)\n\t\tfor(int j = 0; j < m; j++)\n\t\t\tcnt[i + j][a[i][j]]++;\n\tint ans = 0;\n\tfor(int i = 0; i <= n + m - 2; i++)\n\t{\n\t\tint j = n + m - 2 - i;\n\t\tif(i <= j) continue;\n\t\tans += min(cnt[i][0] + cnt[j][0], cnt[i][1] + cnt[j][1]);\n\t}\n\tcout << ans << endl;\n}\n\nint main() {\n\tint t;\n\tcin >> t;\n\tfor(int i = 0; i < t; i++)\n\t\tsolve();\n}", "interactive": false, "noSolution": false, "noTutorial": false}
