Pluses and Minuses", "statement": "You are given a string  consisting only of characters  and . You perform some process with this string. This process can be described by the following pseudocode: Note that the  denotes infinity, and the characters of the string are numbered from  to .You have to calculate the value of the  after the process ends.", "input": "The first line contains one integer  () \u2014 the number of test cases. The only lines of each test case contains string  () consisting only of characters  and . It's guaranteed that sum of  over all test cases doesn't exceed .", "output": "For each test case print one integer \u2014 the value of the  after the process ends.", "tutorial": "Let's replace all  with , and all  with . After that let's create a preffix-sum array  (). Also lets create array  such that  is equal minimum index  such that  (if there is no such index ).Let's consider the first iteration of loop . If  then process ends and . Otherwise the condition  fulfilled then the value of  will be equal to . So, the value of  is equal to  after first iteration.Now, let's consider the second iteration of loop . If  then process ends and . Otherwise the condition  fulfilled then the value of  will be equal to . So, the value of  is equal to  after second iteration.In this way we can calculate the value of  after the process ends.", "solution": "for _ in range(int(input())):\n    s = input()\n    cur, mn, res = 0, 0, len(s)\n    for i in range(len(s)):\n        cur += 1 if s[i] == '+' else -1\n        if cur < mn:\n            mn = cur\n            res += i + 1\n        \n    print(res)", "interactive": false, "noSolution": false, "noTutorial": false}
