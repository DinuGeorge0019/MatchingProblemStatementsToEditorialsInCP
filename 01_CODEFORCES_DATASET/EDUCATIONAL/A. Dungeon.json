Dungeon", "statement": "You are playing a new computer game in which you have to fight monsters. In a dungeon you are trying to clear, you met three monsters; the first of them has  health points, the second has  health points, and the third has .To kill the monsters, you can use a cannon that, when fired, deals  damage to the selected monster. Every -th (i.\u00a0e. shots with numbers , ,  etc.) cannon shot is  and deals  damage to  monsters, not just one of them. If some monster's current amount of health points is , it can't be targeted by a regular shot and does not receive damage from an  shot.You want to pass the dungeon beautifully, i.\u00a0e., kill all the monsters with the same  shot (i.\u00a0e. after some  shot, the health points of each of the monsters should become equal to  ). Each shot must hit a monster, i.\u00a0e. each shot deals damage to at least one monster.", "input": "The first line contains a single integer  () \u2014 the number of test cases. Each test case consists of a single line that contains three integers ,  and  () \u2014 the number of health points each monster has.", "output": "For each test case, print  if you can kill all the monsters with the same  shot. Otherwise, print . You may print each letter in any case (for example, , , ,  will all be recognized as positive answer).", "tutorial": "Note that for every  shots, we deal a total of  units of damage. Since we want to kill all the monsters with a shot which index is divisible by , let's denote the number of shots as . In this case, a total of  units of damage must be dealt, hence  (if the result of the division is not an integer, then there is no answer). Since each monster will receive at least  units of damage (with  shots), the health of each monster must be at least . If the two conditions described above are met, then the remaining shots can always be distributed in the desired way.", "solution": "for i in range(int(input())):\n\ta, b, c = map(int, input().split())\n\tif (a + b + c) % 9 != 0:\n\t\tprint(\"NO\")\n\telse:\n\t    print(\"YES\" if min(a, b, c) >= (a + b + c) // 9 else \"NO\")", "interactive": false, "noSolution": false, "noTutorial": false}
