Alice has  cards, the -th of them has the integer  written on it. Bob has  cards, the -th of them has the integer  written on it.On the first turn of the game,  chooses one of his/her cards and puts it on the table (plays it). On the second turn,  chooses one of his/her cards , and plays it. On the third turn,  chooses one of his/her cards , and plays it, and so on \u2014 the players take turns, and each player has to choose one of his/her cards with greater integer than the card played by the other player on the last turn.If some player cannot make a turn, he/she loses.For example, if Alice has  cards with numbers , and Bob has  cards with numbers , the game may go as follows:  Alice can choose any of her cards. She chooses the card with integer  and plays it.  Bob can choose any of his cards with number greater than . He chooses a card with integer  and plays it.  Alice can choose any of her cards with number greater than . She chooses the card with integer  and plays it.  Bob can choose any of his cards with number greater than . He chooses a card with integer  and plays it.  Alice can choose any of her cards with number greater than , but she has no such cards, so she loses. Both Alice and Bob play .You have to answer two questions:  who wins if Alice is the first player?  who wins if Bob is the first player?

The first line of a test case contains one integer  () \u2014 the number of cards Alice has. The second line contains  integers  () \u2014 the numbers written on the cards that Alice has. The third line contains one integer  () \u2014 the number of Bob's cards. The fourth line contains  integers  () \u2014 the numbers on Bob's cards.", "output": "For each test case, print two lines.
