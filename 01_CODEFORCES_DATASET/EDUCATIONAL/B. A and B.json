You can perform a sequence of operations: during the first operation you choose one of these numbers and increase it by ; during the second operation you choose one of these numbers and increase it by , and so on. You choose the number of these operations yourself.For example, if  and , you can perform the following sequence of three operations:   add  to , then  and ;  add  to , then  and ;  add  to , then  and . Calculate the minimum number of operations required to make  and  equal. ", "input": "The first line contains one integer  () \u2014 the number of test cases. The only line of each test case contains two integers  and  ().", "output": "For each test case print one integer \u2014 the minimum numbers of operations required to make  and  equal. ", "tutorial": "Assume that . Let's denote the minimum number of operations required to make  and  equal as .There are two restrictions on :  At first, , because if  then  will be greater than  (after applying all operations);  Secondly, integers  and  must have the same parity, because if they have different parity, then  and  will have different parity (after applying all operations).It turns out that we always can make integers  and  equal after applying  operations. It's true because we have to add  to  and the rest to . And we can get any integer from  to  as a sum of subset of set .", "solution": "#include <bits/stdc++.h>\n\nusing namespace std;\n\nint t, a, b;\n\nbool ok(int res, int d){\n\tlong long sum = res * 1LL * (res + 1) / 2;\n\tif(sum < d) return false;\n\treturn sum % 2 == d % 2;\n}\t\n\nint main() {\t\t\n\tcin >> t;\n\tfor(int tc = 0; tc < t; ++tc){\n\t\tcin >> a >> b;\n\t\tint d = abs(a - b);\n\t\tif(d == 0){ \n\t\t\tcout << \"0\\n\";\n\t\t\tcontinue;\n\t\t}\n\n\t\tint res = 1;\n\t\twhile(!ok(res, d)) ++res;\n\t\tcout << res << endl;\n\t\t\n\t}\n\treturn 0;\n}", "interactive": false, "noSolution": false, "noTutorial": false}
