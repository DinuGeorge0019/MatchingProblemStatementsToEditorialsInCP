Fair Playoff", "statement": "Four players participate in the playoff tournament. The tournament is held according to the following scheme: the first player will play with the second, and the third player with the fourth, then the winners of the pairs will play in the finals of the tournament.It is known that in a match between two players, the one whose skill is greater will win. The skill of the -th player is equal to  and all skill levels are pairwise different (i.\u2009e. there are no two identical values in the array ).The tournament is called  if the two players with the highest skills meet in the finals.Determine whether the given tournament is .", "input": "The first line contains a single integer  ()\u00a0\u2014 the number of test cases. A single line of test case contains four integers  ()\u00a0\u2014 skill of the players.
