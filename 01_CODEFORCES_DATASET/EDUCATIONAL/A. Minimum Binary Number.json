Minimum Binary Number", "statement": "String can be called  if it consists of characters \"\" and \"\" and there are no redundant leading zeroes. Here are some examples: \"\", \"\", \"\".You are given a  string .You can perform two different operations on this string:   swap any pair of adjacent characters (for example, \"\"  \"\");  replace \"\" with \"\" (for example, \"\"  \"\"). Let  be such a number that  is its binary representation. string  is less than some other  string  iff .Your task is to find the minimum  string that you can obtain from the given one using the operations described above. You can use these operations any number of times in any order (or even use no operations at all).", "input": "The first line contains integer number  () \u2014 the length of string .
