Knights", "statement": "You are given a chess board with  rows and  columns. Initially all cells of the board are empty, and you have to put a white or a black knight into each cell of the board.A knight is a chess piece that can attack a piece in cell (, ) from the cell (, ) if one of the following conditions is met:   and , or   and . Here are some examples of which cells knight can attack. In each of the following pictures, if the knight is currently in the blue cell, it can attack all red cells (and only them).  A  is a pair of knights of  colors such that these knights attack each other. You have to put a knight (a white one or a black one) into each cell in such a way that the number of duels is maximum possible.", "input": "The first line contains one integer  () \u2014 the number of rows (and columns) in the board.", "output": "Print  lines with  characters in each line. The -th character in the -th line should be , if the cell (, ) contains a white knight, or , if it contains a black knight. The number of duels should be maximum possible. If there are multiple optimal answers, print any of them.", "tutorial": "Let's denote a cell (, ) as  if  is even, otherwise the cell is . It's easy to see that if a knight is occupying a black cell, then all cells attacked by it are white, and vice versa.Using this fact, we can construct a solution where every pair of knights that attack each other have different colors \u2014 put black knights into black cells, and white knights into white cells, so every pair of knights that can possibly form a duel actually form it.", "solution": "n = int(input())\nfor i in range(n):\n\tprint(''.join(['W' if (i + j) % 2 == 0 else 'B' for j in range(n)]))", "interactive": false, "noSolution": false, "noTutorial": false}
