Minimums and Maximums", "statement": "An array is  if both of the following two conditions meet:  there are   and   elements in the array equal to its minimum;  there are   and   elements in the array equal to its maximum. For example, the array  has  elements equal to its minimum (-st, -rd and -th) and  elements equal to its maximum (-th and -th).Another example: the array  has  elements equal to its minimum and  elements equal to its maximum.Your task is to calculate the  possible number of elements in a  array.", "input": "The first line contains one integer  ()\u00a0\u2014 the number of test cases. Each test case consists of one line containing four integers , ,  and  (; ).", "output": "For each test case, print one integer\u00a0\u2014 the minimum possible number of elements in a beautiful array.", "tutorial": "Firstly, since we are interested in minimum possible size of the array, we don't need any elements other than minimums and maximums. So, the array has at most  distinct elements.Now there are many possible solutions. The simplest one is to iterate on the number of minimums (let this be ) and maximums (let this be ). If the number of minimums is equal to the number of maximums, then the array should have all elements as both its minimums and maximums, so its length should be ; otherwise, it should be . We can iterate on all possible pairs  and find the best result over all of them.A solution in  is possible if you see that you only have to consider  and  as the number of minimums/maximums, or check if the segments  and  intersect in .", "solution": "t = int(input())\nfor i in range(t):\n    l1, r1, l2, r2 = map(int, input().split())\n    if max(l1, l2) <= min(r1, r2):\n        print(max(l1, l2))\n    else:\n        print(l1 + l2)", "interactive": false, "noSolution": false, "noTutorial": false}
