Immobile Knight", "statement": "There is a chess board of size . The rows are numbered from  to , the columns are numbered from  to .Let's call a cell  if a knight placed in that cell can't move to any other cell on the board. Recall that a chess knight moves two cells in one direction and one cell in a perpendicular direction:   Find any  cell on the board. If there are no such cells, print any cell on the board.", "input": "The first line contains a single integer  ()\u00a0\u2014 the number of testcases. The only line of each testcase contains two integers  and  ()\u00a0\u2014 the number of rows and columns of the board.", "output": "For each testcase, print two integers\u00a0\u2014 the row and the column of any  cell on the board. If there are no such cells, print any cell on the board.", "tutorial": "Let's consider some cases.If at least one of  or  are , then all cells are isolated. A knight can't move one in a perpendicular direction.If at least one of  or  are at least , then the knight always has at least one move. No matter where you place it, it can move two cells along the greater of the dimensions and move one in a perpendicular direction, because it's at least .Three cases are left. ,  and . For all of these cases, the middle cell is isolated. That cell is .Since it doesn't matter which cell you print in the first two cases, you can always print .Overall complexity:  per testcase.Alternatively, you can check every possible cell. Iterate over a cell and check all eight possible knight moves from it. If none are inside the board, the cell is isolated.Overall complexity:  per testcase.", "solution": "for _ in range(int(input())):\n\tn, m = map(int, input().split())\n\tprint(n // 2 + 1, m // 2 + 1)", "interactive": false, "noSolution": false, "noTutorial": false}
