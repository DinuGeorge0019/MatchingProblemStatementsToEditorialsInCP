Diverse Substring", "statement": "You are given a string , consisting of  lowercase Latin letters.A substring of string  is a continuous segment of letters from . For example, \"\" is a substring of \"\" and \"\" is not. The length of the substring is the number of letters in it.Let's call some string of length   if and only if there is no letter to appear strictly more than  times. For example, strings \"\" and \"\" are  and strings \"\" and \"\" are not.Your task is to find   substring of string  or report that there is none. Note that it is not required to maximize or minimize the length of the resulting substring.", "input": "The first line contains a single integer  () \u2014 the length of string . The second line is the string , consisting of exactly  lowercase Latin letters.", "output": "Print \"\" if there is no  substring in the string . Otherwise the first line should contain \"\". The second line should contain   substring of string .", "tutorial": "Notice that the string of two distinct letter is already diverse. That implies that the answer is \"\" if and only if all the letters in the string are the same. Otherwise you can check all pairs of adjacent letters in .Overall complexity: .", "solution": "n = int(input())\ns = input()\nfor i in range(n - 1):\n\tif (s[i] != s[i + 1]):\n\t\tprint(\"YES\")\n\t\tprint(s[i], s[i + 1], sep=\"\")\n\t\texit(0)\nprint(\"NO\")", "interactive": false, "noSolution": false, "noTutorial": false}
