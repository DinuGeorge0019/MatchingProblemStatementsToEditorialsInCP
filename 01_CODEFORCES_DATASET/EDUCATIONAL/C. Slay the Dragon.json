Slay the Dragon", "statement": "Recently, Petya learned about a new game \"Slay the Dragon\". As the name suggests, the player will have to fight with dragons. To defeat a dragon, you have to kill it and defend your castle. To do this, the player has a squad of  heroes, the strength of the -th hero is equal to .According to the rules of the game, exactly one hero should go kill the dragon, all the others will defend the castle. If the dragon's defense is equal to , then you have to send a hero with a strength of at least  to kill it. If the dragon's attack power is , then the total strength of the heroes defending the castle should be at least .The player can increase the strength of any hero by  for one gold coin. This operation can be done any number of times.There are  dragons in the game, the -th of them has defense equal to  and attack power equal to . Petya was wondering what is the minimum number of coins he needs to spend to defeat the -th dragon.Note that the task is solved  (improvements are not saved).", "input": "The first line contains a single integer  ()\u00a0\u2014 number of heroes. The second line contains  integers  (), where  is the strength of the -th hero. The third line contains a single integer  ()\u00a0\u2014 the number of dragons. The next  lines contain two integers each,  and  ()\u00a0\u2014 defense and attack power of the -th dragon.", "output": "Print  lines, -th of which contains a single integer\u00a0\u2014 the minimum number of coins that should be spent to defeat the -th dragon.", "tutorial": "It is enough to consider two cases: whether we will increase the strength of the hero who will kill the dragon or not.If you do not increase the hero's strength, then you have to choose such  that . Obviously, among such , you have to choose with the minimum value , because the strength of defending heroes is equal to . It remains to increase the total strength of the remaining heroes to . So the required number of coins is equal to .If you increase the hero's strength, then you have to choose the maximum value of , which is less than . In this case, the required number of coins is  to increase the strength of the hero who will kill the dragon, plus  to increase the strength of the defending heroes.To find the heroes with strength as close to  as possible, you can use binary search (don't forget to sort the heroes beforehand).", "solution": "#include <bits/stdc++.h>\n\nusing namespace std;\n\nusing li = long long;\n\nint main() {\n  ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);\n  cin.tie(NULL); \n  int n;\n  cin >> n;\n  vector<li> a(n);\n  for (auto &x : a) cin >> x;\n  sort(a.begin(), a.end());\n  li sum = accumulate(a.begin(), a.end(), 0LL);\n  int m;\n  cin >> m;\n  while (m--) {\n    li x, y;\n    cin >> x >> y;\n    int i = lower_bound(a.begin(), a.end(), x) - a.begin();\n    li ans = 2e18;\n    if (i > 0) ans = min(ans, (x - a[i - 1]) + max(0LL, y - sum + a[i - 1]));\n    if (i < n) ans = min(ans, max(0LL, y - sum + a[i]));\n    cout << ans << '\\n';\n  }\n}", "interactive": false, "noSolution": false, "noTutorial": false}
