GCD Length", "statement": "You are given three integers ,  and .Find two positive integers  and  (, ) such that:   the decimal representation of  without leading zeroes consists of  digits;  the decimal representation of  without leading zeroes consists of  digits;  the decimal representation of  without leading zeroes consists of  digits.  denotes the greatest common divisor (GCD) of integers  and .Output  and . If there are multiple answers, output any of them.", "input": "The first line contains a single integer  ()\u00a0\u2014 the number of testcases. Each of the next  lines contains three integers ,  and  (, )\u00a0\u2014 the required lengths of the numbers. It can be shown that the answer exists for all testcases under the given constraints. Additional constraint on the input: all testcases are different.", "output": "For each testcase print two positive integers\u00a0\u2014  and  (, ) such that    the decimal representation of  without leading zeroes consists of  digits;  the decimal representation of  without leading zeroes consists of  digits;  the decimal representation of  without leading zeroes consists of  digits. ", "tutorial": "The easiest way to force some gcd to be of some fixed length is to use the divisibility rules for ,  or : if the number produced by the last  digits  is divisible by , then  is also divisible by  (same goes for  and ).One of the possible constructions is the following: let  and . Since  and  are pairwise prime, gcd is .Overall complexity:  per testcase.", "solution": "for t in range(int(input())):\n\ta, b, c = map(int, input().split())\n\tprint(\"1\" + \"0\" * (a - 1), \"1\" * (b - c + 1) + \"0\" * (c - 1))", "interactive": false, "noSolution": false, "noTutorial": false}
