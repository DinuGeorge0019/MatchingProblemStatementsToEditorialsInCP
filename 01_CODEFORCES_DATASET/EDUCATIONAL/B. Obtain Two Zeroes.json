Obtain Two Zeroes", "statement": "You are given two integers  and . You may perform any number of operations on them (possibly zero).During each operation you should choose any positive integer  and set ,  or , . Note that you may choose different values of  in different operations.Is it possible to make  and  equal to  simultaneously?Your program should answer  independent test cases.", "input": "The first line contains one integer  () \u2014 the number of test cases. Then the test cases follow, each test case is represented by one line containing two integers  and  for this test case ().", "output": "For each test case print the answer to it \u2014  if it is possible to make  and  equal to  simultaneously, and  otherwise. You may print every letter in any case you want (so, for example, the strings , ,  and  will all be recognized as positive answer).", "tutorial": "Let's assume . Then the answer is  if two following conditions holds:   , because after each operation the value  does not change;  . ", "solution": "for t in range(int(input())):\n\ta, b = map(int, input().split())\n\tif a > b:\n\t\ta, b = b, a\n\tprint ('YES' if ( ((a + b) % 3) == 0 and a * 2 >= b) else 'NO')", "interactive": false, "noSolution": false, "noTutorial": false}
