Joty and Chocolate", "statement": "Little Joty has got a task to do. She has a line of  tiles indexed from  to . She has to paint them in a strange pattern.An unpainted tile should be painted Red if it's index is divisible by  and an unpainted tile should be painted Blue if it's index is divisible by . So the tile with the number divisible by  and  can be either painted Red or Blue.After her painting is done, she will get  chocolates for each tile that is painted Red and  chocolates for each tile that is painted Blue.Note that she can paint tiles in any order she wants.Given the required information, find the maximum\u00a0number of chocolates Joty can get.", "input": "The only line contains five integers , , ,  and  ().", "output": "Print the only integer  \u2014 the maximum number of chocolates Joty can get. Note that the answer can be too large, so you should use -bit integer type to store it. In  you can use the  integer type and in  you can use  integer type.", "tutorial": "Easy to see that we can paint with both colours only tiles with the numbers multiple of .
