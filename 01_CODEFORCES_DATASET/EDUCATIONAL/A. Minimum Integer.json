This can be done as follows: we calculate the number of elements divisible by  that are not greater than  as , and then we take -th element, which is .", "solution": "q = int(input())\nfor i in range(q):\n    l, r, d = map(int, input().split())\n    if(d < l or d > r):\n        print(d)\n    else:\n        print((r // d) * d + d)", "interactive": false, "noSolution": false, "noTutorial": false}
