Vasya's Function", "statement": "Vasya is studying number theory. He has denoted a function  such that:  ;  , where  is the greatest common divisor of  and . Vasya has two numbers  and , and he wants to calculate . He tried to do it by himself, but found out that calculating this function the way he wants to do that might take very long time. So he decided to ask you to implement a program that will calculate this function swiftly.", "input": "The first line contains two integer numbers  and  ().", "output": "Print .", "tutorial": "One important fact is that when we subtract  from , new  will be divisible by old . And, of course,  is always divisible by .Let's factorize . Consider the moment when  changes. If we denote old value of  by , the new value of  will be divisible by some , where  is a prime divisor of . Let's check all prime divisors of  and for each of these divisors find the number of times we need to subtract  from  to get  divisible by ; that is just  (don't forget that  also has to be divisible by ). Among all prime divisors of  pick one with the minimum required number of operations (let this number of operations be ), add  to answer, subtract  from  and repeat the process.", "solution": "#include <stdio.h>\n#include <algorithm>\n#include <assert.h>\n#include <bitset>\n#include <cmath>\n#include <complex>\n#include <deque>\n#include <functional>\n#include <iostream>\n#include <limits.h>\n#include <map>\n#include <math.h>\n#include <queue>\n#include <set>\n#include <stdlib.h>\n#include <string.h>\n#include <string>\n#include <time.h>\n#include <unordered_map>\n#include <unordered_set>\n#include <vector>\n\n#pragma warning(disable:4996)\n#pragma comment(linker, \"/STACK:1048576\")\nusing namespace std;\n\n#define mp make_pair\n#define all(x) (x).begin(), (x).end()\n#define ldb ldouble\n#define rf(x) (x)=0;while(*p<48)p++;while(47<*p)(x)=((x)<<3)+((x)<<1)+(*p++&15);\n\ntypedef long long ll;\ntypedef unsigned long long ull;\ntypedef double db;\ntypedef long double ldb;\ntypedef pair <int, int> pii;\ntypedef pair <ll, ll> pll;\ntypedef pair <ll, int> pli;\ntypedef pair <db, db> pdd;\ntypedef tuple <int, int, int> t3;\n\nint IT_MAX = 1 << 18;\nconst ll MOD = 1000000009;\nconst int INF = 0x3f3f3f3f;\nconst ll LL_INF = 1234567890123456789ll;\nconst db PI = acos(-1);\nconst db EPS = 1e-8;\n#define szz(x) (int)(x).size()\n#define rep(i, n) for(int i=0;i<(n);i++)\n\nll gcd(ll a, ll b) {\n\treturn (a == 0) ? b : gcd(b%a, a);\n}\nll aa(ll a, ll b) {\n\tif (b == 0) return 0;\n\n\tll g = gcd(a, b);\n\ta = a / g, b = b / g;\n\n\tll oa = a;\n\tll mn = b;\n\tfor (ll i = 2; i * i <= a; i++) {\n\t\tif (a % i) continue;\n\t\tmn = min(mn, b%i);\n\t\twhile (a % i == 0) a /= i;\n\t}\n\tif (a != 1) mn = min(mn, b%a);\n\treturn aa(oa, b - mn) + mn;\n}\n\nint main() {\n\tll X, Y;\n\tscanf(\"%lld %lld\", &X, &Y);\n\treturn !printf(\"%lld\\n\", aa(X, Y));\n}\n", "interactive": false, "noSolution": false, "noTutorial": false}
