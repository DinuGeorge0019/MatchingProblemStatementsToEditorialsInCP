During each move, the current player must choose two  characters of string  and delete them. For example, if  then the following moves are possible:   delete  and : ;  delete  and : ;  delete  and : ;  delete  and : . If a player can't make any move, they lose. Both players play optimally. You have to determine if Alice can win.", "input": "First line contains one integer  ()\u00a0\u2014 the number of test cases. Only line of each test case contains one string  (), consisting of only characters  and .", "output": "For each test case print answer in the single line. If Alice can win print  (YES in Russian) in any register. Otherwise print  (NO in Russian) in any register.", "tutorial": "If there is at least one character  and at least one character , then current player can always make a move. After the move the number of character  decreases by one, and the number of character  decreases by one too. So the number of moves is always , where  is the number of characters  in string , and  is the number of characters  in string .So if  is odd then Alice wins, otherwise Bob wins.
