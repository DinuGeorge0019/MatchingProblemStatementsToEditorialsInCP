Buying Torches", "statement": "You are playing a very popular game called Cubecraft. Initially, you have one stick and want to craft  torches. One torch can be crafted using .Hopefully, you've met a very handsome wandering trader who has two trade offers:  exchange  stick for  sticks (you lose  stick and gain  sticks).  exchange  sticks for  coal (you lose  sticks and gain  coal). During one trade, you can use  of these two trade offers. You can use each trade offer any number of times you want to, in any order.Your task is to find the minimum number of trades you need to craft at least  torches. The answer always exists under the given constraints.You have to answer  independent test cases.", "input": "The first line of the input contains one integer  () \u2014 the number of test cases. Then  test cases follow. The only line of the test case contains three integers ,  and  (; ) \u2014 the number of sticks you can buy with one stick, the number of sticks required to buy one coal and the number of torches you need, respectively.", "output": "For each test case, print the answer: the minimum number of trades you need to craft at least  torches. The answer always exists under the given constraints.", "tutorial": "You need  additional sticks to get  torches ( sticks for  units of coal and also  sticks required to craft torches) and you get  sticks per one trade. To buy this number of sticks, you need  trades. And also, you need  additional trades to turn some sticks into coals.
