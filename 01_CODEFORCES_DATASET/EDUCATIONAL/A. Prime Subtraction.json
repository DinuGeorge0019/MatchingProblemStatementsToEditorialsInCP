Prime Subtraction", "statement": "You are given two integers  and  (it is guaranteed that ). You may choose any  integer  and subtract it any number of times from . Is it possible to make  equal to ?Recall that a  number is a positive integer that has exactly two positive divisors:  and this integer itself. The sequence of prime numbers starts with , , , , .Your program should solve  independent test cases.", "input": "The first line contains one integer  () \u2014 the number of test cases. Then  lines follow, each describing a test case. Each line contains two integers  and  ().", "output": "For each test case, print  if it is possible to choose a prime number  and subtract it any number of times from  so that  becomes equal to . Otherwise, print . You may print every letter in any case you want (so, for example, the strings , , , and  will all be recognized as positive answer).", "tutorial": "Let's denote the difference between  and  as  (). Then, if  has a prime divisor , we can subtract  from   times.The only positive integer that doesn't have any prime divisors is . So, the answer is  if and only if .", "solution": "t = int(input())\n\nfor i in range(t):\n\tx, y = map(int, input().split())\n\tif(x - y > 1):\n\t\tprint('YES')\n\telse:\n\t\tprint('NO')", "interactive": false, "noSolution": false, "noTutorial": false}
