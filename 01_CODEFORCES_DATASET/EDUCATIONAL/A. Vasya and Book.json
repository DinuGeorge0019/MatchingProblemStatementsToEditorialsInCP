The file of the book consists of  pages, numbered from  to . The screen is currently displaying the contents of page , and Vasya wants to read the page . There are two buttons on the book which allow Vasya to scroll  pages forwards or backwards (but he cannot scroll outside the book). For example, if the book consists of  pages, and , then from the first page Vasya can scroll to the first or to the fourth page by pressing one of the buttons; from the second page \u2014 to the first or to the fifth; from the sixth page \u2014 to the third or to the ninth; from the eighth \u2014 to the fifth or to the tenth.Help Vasya to calculate the minimum number of times he needs to press a button to move to page .", "input": "The first line contains one integer  () \u2014 the number of testcases. Each testcase is denoted by a line containing four integers , , ,  (, ) \u2014 the number of pages, the starting page, the desired page, and the number of pages scrolled by pressing one button, respectively.", "output": "Print one line for each test. If Vasya can move from page  to page , print the minimum number of times he needs to press a button to do it. Otherwise print .", "tutorial": "It is easy to understand that the optimal answer is achieved in one of three cases:   Vasya is trying to visit page  without visiting pages  and ;  Vasya first goes to the page , and then to the page ;  Vasya first goes to the  page, and then to the  page. In the first case, Vasya can go directly to the  page from the  page if  is divided by .In the second case, Vasya can get to page  through page , if  is divided by . The required number of actions will be equal to .Similarly, in the third case, Vasya can go to the page  through the page  if  is divided by . The required number of actions will be equal to .If none of the three options described above is appropriate, then there is no answer.", "solution": "#include <bits/stdc++.h>\n\nusing namespace std;\n\nconst int INF = int(2e9) + 99;\n\nint n, x, y, d;\n\nint dist(int x, int y){\n\treturn (abs(x - y) + (d - 1)) / d;\n}\n\nint main() {\n\t\n\tint t;\n\tcin >> t;\n\tfor(int i = 0; i < t; ++i){\n    \tcin >> n >> x >> y >> d;\n    \t\n    \tint len = abs(x - y);\n    \tint res = INF;\n    \t\n    \tif(len % d == 0) \n    \t\tres = min(res, dist(x, y));\n    \t\n    \tlen = y - 1;\n    \tif(len % d == 0)\n    \t\tres = min(res, dist(x, 1) + dist(1, y));\n    \t\n    \tlen = n - y;\n    \tif(len % d == 0)\n    \t\tres = min(res, dist(x, n) + dist(n, y));\n    \t\t\n    \tif(res == INF)\n    \t\tres = -1;\n    \t\n    \tcout << res << endl;\n\t}\n\t\n\treturn 0;\n}", "interactive": false, "noSolution": false, "noTutorial": false}
