The Best Gift", "statement": "Emily's birthday is next week and Jack has decided to buy a present for her. He knows she loves books so he goes to the local bookshop, where there are  books on sale from one of  genres.In the bookshop, Jack decides to buy .Based on the genre of books on sale in the shop, find the number of options available to Jack for choosing two books of different genres for Emily. Options are considered different if they differ in at least one book.The books are given by indices of their genres. The genres are numbered from  to .", "input": "The first line contains two positive integers  and  () \u2014 the number of books in the bookstore and the number of genres. The second line contains a sequence , where  () equals the genre of the -th book. It is guaranteed that for each genre there is at least one book of that genre.", "output": "Print the only integer \u2014 the number of ways in which Jack can choose books. It is guaranteed that the answer doesn't exceed the value .", "tutorial": "Let's denote cnti \u2014 the number of books of i th genre. The answer to problem is equals to . In first sum we are calculating the number of good pairs, while in second we are subtracting the number of bad pairs from the number of all pairs.\nComplexity: O(n\u2009+\u2009m2) or O(n\u2009+\u2009m).\n", "solution": "/*\nIn thrall to the evil lord\nA procession of the damned\nSweating blood to serve the beast\nDesolation of their souls\n\nThey slave in fire\nWhips of Hades at their backs\nThe Scourge of Iron\nHell's eternal pact\n\nLash them\nRip their skin\nScourge of Iron\nRending flesh\n\nOn earth they lived by force\nNow the villains march in chains\nMen of violence doomed in death\nTheir reward for a life of sin\n\nThey slave for eons\nThere will be no relief\nMere pawns of evil\nUsed and then enslaved\n\nLash them\nRip their skin\nScourge of Iron\nRending flesh\n\nLash\nRip their skin\nScourge of Iron\nRending flesh\n\nDemonic sadists\nFlay the damned with steel\nThe whip strips flesh\n\nTorments beyond the material world\nSkinless, bleeding\nRobbed of pride and power\n\nIn the grip of the infernal\nAnd the evil will not die\nIron whip will be relentless\nAnd the pain will never end\n\nLash them\nRip their skin\nScourge of iron\nRending flesh\n\nLash\nRip their skin\nScourge of Iron\nRending flesh\n*/\n\n//#pragma comment(linker, \"/STACK:16777216\")\n#define _CRT_SECURE_NO_WARNINGS\n#include <fstream>\n#include <iostream>\n#include <string>\n#include <complex>\n#include <math.h>\n#include <set>\n#include <vector>\n#include <map>  \n#include <queue>\n#include <stdio.h>\n#include <stack>\n#include <algorithm>\n#include <list>\n#include <ctime>\n#include <memory.h>\n#include <ctime> \n#include <assert.h>\n\n#define y0 sdkfaslhagaklsldk\n#define y1 aasdfasdfasdf\n#define yn askfhwqriuperikldjk\n#define j1 assdgsdgasghsf\n#define tm sdfjahlfasfh\n#define lr asgasgash\n\n#define eps 1e-8\n#define M_PI 3.141592653589793\n#define bs 1234567891\n#define bsize 512\n\nconst int N = 1100;\n\nusing namespace std;\n\nlong long ans;\nint n, m;\nlong long cnt[N];\n\nint main(){\n\t//freopen(\"beavers.in\",\"r\",stdin);\n\t//freopen(\"beavers.out\",\"w\",stdout);\n\t//freopen(\"F:/in.txt\",\"r\",stdin);\n\t//freopen(\"F:/output.txt\",\"w\",stdout);\n\t//ios_base::sync_with_stdio(0);\n\t//cin.tie(0);\n\n\tcin >> n >> m;\n\tfor (int i = 0; i < n; i++)\n\t{\n\t\tint val;\n\t\tcin >> val;\n\t\tcnt[val]++;\n\t}\n\n\tans = 1ll * n*(n - 1) / 2;\n\n\tfor (int i = 1; i <= m; i++)\n\t{\n\t\tlong long val = cnt[i];\n\t\tans -= val*(val - 1) / 2;\n\t}\n\tcout << ans << endl;\n\n\tcin.get();\n\treturn 0;\n}", "interactive": false, "noSolution": false, "noTutorial": false}
