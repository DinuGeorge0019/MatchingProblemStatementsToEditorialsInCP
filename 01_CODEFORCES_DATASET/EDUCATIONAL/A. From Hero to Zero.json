From Hero to Zero", "statement": "You are given an integer  and an integer .In one step you can do one of the following moves:   decrease  by ;  divide  by  if  is divisible by . For example, if  and  you can do the following steps: .You are asked to calculate the minimum number of steps to reach  from . ", "input": "The first line contains one integer  () \u2014 the number of queries. The only line of each query contains two integers  and  (, ).", "output": "For each query print the minimum number of steps to reach  from  in single line. ", "tutorial": "It's always optimal to divide by  whenever it's possible, since dividing by  equivalent to decreasing  by .The only problem is that it's too slow to just subtract  from  each time, since in the worst case we can make  operations (Consider case  and ).But if we'd look closer then we can just replace  times of subtract  with one subtraction of . And to make  is divisible by  we should make  subtractions.", "solution": "#include<bits/stdc++.h>\n\nusing namespace std;\n\nlong long n, k;\n\nint main(){\n    int tc;\n    cin >> tc;\n    for(int i = 0; i < tc; ++i){\n    \tcin >> n >> k;\n    \tlong long res = 0;\n    \twhile(n > 0){\n    \t    if(n % k == 0){\n    \t        n /= k;\n    \t        ++res;\n    \t    }\n    \t    else{\n    \t        long long rem = n % k;\n    \t        res += rem;\n    \t        n -= rem;\n    \t    }\n    \t}\n    \t\n    \tcout << res << endl;\n    }\n\treturn 0;\n}", "interactive": false, "noSolution": false, "noTutorial": false}
