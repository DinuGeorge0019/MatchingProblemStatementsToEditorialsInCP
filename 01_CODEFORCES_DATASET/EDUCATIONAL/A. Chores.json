Chores", "statement": "Luba has to do  chores today. -th chore takes  units of time to complete. It is guaranteed that for every  the condition  is met, so the sequence is sorted.Also Luba can work really hard on some chores. She can choose not more than  any chores and do each of them in  units of time instead of  ().Luba is very responsible, so she has to do all  chores, and now she wants to know the minimum time she needs to do everything. Luba cannot do two chores simultaneously.", "input": "The first line contains three integers ) \u2014 the number of chores Luba has to do, the number of chores she can do in  units of time, and the number  itself. The second line contains  integer numbers  \u2014 the time Luba has to spend to do -th chore. It is guaranteed that , and for each  .", "output": "Print one number \u2014 minimum time Luba needs to do all  chores.", "tutorial": "Since , it is better to do exactly  chores in time .
