HDD is Outdated Technology", "statement": "HDD hard drives group data by sectors. All files are split to fragments and each of them are written in some sector of hard drive. Note the fragments can be written in sectors in arbitrary order.One of the problems of HDD hard drives is the following: the magnetic head should move from one sector to another to read some file.Find the time need to read file split to  fragments. The -th sector contains the -th fragment of the file (). Note different sectors contains the different fragments. At the start the magnetic head is in the position that contains the first fragment. The file are reading in the following manner: at first the first fragment is read, then the magnetic head moves to the sector that contains the second fragment, then the second fragment is read and so on until the -th fragment is read. The fragments are read in the order from the first to the -th.It takes  time units to move the magnetic head from the sector  to the sector . Reading a fragment takes no time.", "input": "The first line contains a positive integer  () \u2014 the number of fragments. The second line contains  different integers  () \u2014 the number of the fragment written in the -th sector.", "output": "Print the only integer \u2014 the number of time units needed to read the file.", "tutorial": "You are given the permutation f. Let's build another permutation p in the following way: pfi\u2009=\u2009i. So the permutation p defines the number of sector by the number of fragment. The permutation p is called inverse permutation to f and denoted f\u2009-\u20091.
