Two Regular Polygons", "statement": "You are given two integers  and  (). Consider a  regular polygon of  vertices. Recall that a regular polygon is a polygon that is equiangular (all angles are equal in measure) and equilateral (all sides have the same length).  Examples of convex regular polygons Your task is to say if it is possible to build another  regular polygon with  vertices such that its center coincides with the center of the initial polygon and each of its vertices is some vertex of the initial polygon.You have to answer  independent test cases.", "input": "The first line of the input contains one integer  () \u2014 the number of test cases. The next  lines describe test cases. Each test case is given as two space-separated integers  and  () \u2014 the number of vertices in the initial polygon and the number of vertices in the polygon you want to build.", "output": "For each test case, print the answer \u2014 \"\" (without quotes), if it is possible to build another  regular polygon with  vertices such that its center coincides with the center of the initial polygon and each of its vertices is some vertex of the initial polygon and \"\" otherwise.", "tutorial": "The answer is \"\" if and only if  is divisible by  because if you number all vertices of the initial polygon from  to  clockwise then you need to take every vertex divisible by  (and this number obviously should be integer) and there is no other way to construct the other polygon.", "solution": "for i in range(int(input())):\n    n, m = map(int, input().split())\n    print('YES' if n % m == 0 else 'NO')", "interactive": false, "noSolution": false, "noTutorial": false}
