Sum of Cubes", "statement": "You are given a positive integer . Check whether the number  is representable as the sum of the cubes of two positive integers.Formally, you need to check if there are two integers  and  () such that .For example, if , then the numbers  and  are suitable (). If , then no pair of numbers  and  is suitable.", "input": "The first line contains one integer  ()\u00a0\u2014 the number of test cases. Then  test cases follow. Each test case contains one integer  (). Please note, that the input for some test cases won't fit into -bit integer type, so you should use at least -bit integer type in your programming language.", "output": "For each test case, output on a separate line:    \"\" if  is representable as the sum of the cubes of two positive integers.  \"\" otherwise.  You can output \"\" and \"\" in any case (for example, the strings , ,  and  will be recognized as positive).", "tutorial": "In this problem, we need to find  and  such that  and .Since  and  are positive,  and  are also positive. Hence . Therefore, the number  can be iterated from  to . Since in all tests , then .For each  , you can find  by the formula . This is a positive number. It remains to check that  is an integer.", "solution": "#include <bits/stdc++.h>\n\nusing namespace std;\nusing ll = long long;\nusing ld = long double;\n\nconst ll N = 1'000'000'000'000L;\n\nunordered_set<ll> cubes;\n\nvoid precalc() {\n  for (ll i = 1; i * i * i <= N; i++) {\n    cubes.insert(i * i * i);\n  }\n}\n\nvoid solve() {\n  ll x;\n  cin >> x;\n  for (ll i = 1; i * i * i <= x; i++) {\n    if (cubes.count(x - i * i * i)) {\n      cout << \"YES\\n\";\n      return;\n    }\n  }\n  cout << \"NO\\n\";\n}\n\nint main() {\n  precalc();\n  int t;\n  cin >> t;\n  while (t--) {\n    solve();\n  }\n}", "interactive": false, "noSolution": false, "noTutorial": false}
