Yes-Yes ", "statement": "You talked to Polycarp and asked him a question. You know that when he wants to answer \"yes\", he repeats  many times in a row.Because of the noise, you only heard part of the answer\u00a0\u2014 some substring of it. That is, if he answered , then you could hear , , , , but you couldn't ,  or .Determine if it is true that the given string  is a substring of  ( repeated many times in a row).", "input": "The first line of input data contains the singular  ()\u00a0\u2014 the number of test cases in the test. Each test case is described by a single string of Latin letters  ()\u00a0\u2014 the part of Polycarp's answer that you heard, where  \u2014 is the length of the string .", "output": "Output  lines, each of which is the answer to the corresponding test case. As an answer, output \"\" if the specified string  is a substring of the string  (the number of words  is arbitrary), and \"\" otherwise. You can output the answer in any case (for example, the strings \"\", \"\", \"\" and \"\" will be recognized as a positive answer).", "tutorial": "Note that it is enough to consider the string , where  is written  times, since , and our substring  has size .Then we just use the built-in function  to find out if our string  is a substring of the string .", "solution": "full = 'Yes' * 18\nt = int(input())\nfor _ in range(t):\n    if full.find(input()) >= 0:\n        print('YES')\n    else:\n        print('NO')", "interactive": false, "noSolution": false, "noTutorial": false}
