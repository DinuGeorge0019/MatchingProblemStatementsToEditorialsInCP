Remove Duplicates", "statement": "Petya has an array  consisting of  integers. He wants to remove duplicate (equal) elements.Petya wants to leave only the rightmost entry (occurrence) for each element of the array. The relative order of the remaining unique elements should not be changed.", "input": "The first line contains a single integer  () \u2014 the number of elements in Petya's array. The following line contains a sequence  () \u2014 the Petya's array.", "output": "In the first line print integer  \u2014 the number of elements which will be left in Petya's array after he removed the duplicates. In the second line print  integers separated with a space \u2014 Petya's array after he removed the duplicates. For each unique element only the rightmost entry should be left.", "tutorial": "We will store integers which we already met in a set . Let's iterate through the given array from the right to the left. Let the current element is equal to . So, if  does not contain in  we add  in a vector-answer  and add  in .After we considered all elements the answer sequence contains in the vector  in reversed order. So we should reverse the vector  and simply print all its elements.
