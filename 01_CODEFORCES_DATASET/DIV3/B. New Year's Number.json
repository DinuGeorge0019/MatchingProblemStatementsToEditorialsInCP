New Year's Number", "statement": "Polycarp remembered the -th year, and he is happy with the arrival of the new -th year. To remember such a wonderful moment, Polycarp wants to represent the number  as the sum of a certain number of  and a certain number of .For example, if:   , then the number  can be represented as the sum ;  , then the number  can be represented as the sum ;  , then the number  can be represented as the sum ;  , then the number  cannot be represented as the sum of the numbers  and . Help Polycarp to find out whether the number  can be represented as the sum of a certain number of numbers  and a certain number of numbers .", "input": "The first line contains one integer  ()\u00a0\u2014 the number of test cases. Then  test cases follow. Each test case contains one integer  ()\u00a0\u2014 the number that Polycarp wants to represent as the sum of the numbers  and .", "output": "For each test case, output on a separate line:    \"\" if the number  is representable as the sum of a certain number of  and a certain number of ;  \"\" otherwise.  You can output \"\" and \"\" in any case (for example, the strings , ,  and  will be recognized as positive).", "tutorial": "Let \u00a0\u2014 the number of , \u00a0\u2014 the number of  (). Let us write the required decomposition of the number :  Then we get that  is divisible by . Take  equal to the remainder of  divided by . Then  is uniquely determined from the formula above:  Then, if the result is that  ( because the remainder of dividing  by  is non-negative), then  can be represented as the sum of a certain number of  and a certain number of .", "solution": "#include <bits/stdc++.h>\n\n#include <utility>\nusing namespace std;\n\nusing pii = pair<int, int>;\n\nint main() {\n  int test;\n  cin >> test;\n  while (test-- > 0) {\n    int n;\n    cin >> n;\n    int cnt2021 = n % 2020;\n    int cnt2020 = (n - cnt2021) / 2020 - cnt2021;\n    if (cnt2020 >= 0 && 2020 * cnt2020 + 2021 * cnt2021 == n) {\n      cout << \"YES\\n\";\n    } else {\n      cout << \"NO\\n\";\n    }\n  }\n  return 0;\n}", "interactive": false, "noSolution": false, "noTutorial": false}
