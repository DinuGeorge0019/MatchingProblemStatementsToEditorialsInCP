Restoring Three Numbers", "statement": "Polycarp has guessed three positive integers ,  and . He keeps these numbers in secret, but he writes down four numbers on a board in arbitrary order \u2014 their pairwise sums (three numbers) and sum of all three numbers (one number). So, there are four numbers on a board in random order: , ,  and .You have to guess three numbers ,  and  using given numbers. Print three guessed integers in any order.Pay attention that some given numbers ,  and  can be equal (it is also possible that ).", "input": "The only line of the input contains four positive integers  () \u2014 numbers written on a board in random order. It is guaranteed that the answer exists for the given number .", "output": "Print such positive integers ,  and  that four numbers written on a board are values , ,  and  written in some order. Print ,  and  in any order. If there are several answers, you can print any. It is guaranteed that the answer exists.", "tutorial": "Let , ,  and . Then we can construct the following answer: ,  and .Because all numbers in the answer are positive, we can assume that the maximum element of  is . So let's sort the input array  consisting of four elements and just print  and .", "solution": "#include <bits/stdc++.h>\n\nusing namespace std;\n\nint main() {\n#ifdef _DEBUG\n\tfreopen(\"input.txt\", \"r\", stdin);\n//\tfreopen(\"output.txt\", \"w\", stdout);\n#endif\n\t\n\tvector<int> a(4);\n\tfor (int i = 0; i < 4; ++i) {\n\t\tcin >> a[i];\n\t}\n\tsort(a.begin(), a.end());\n\tcout << a[3] - a[0] << \" \" << a[3] - a[1] << \" \" << a[3] - a[2] << endl;\n\t\n\treturn 0;\n}", "interactive": false, "noSolution": false, "noTutorial": false}
