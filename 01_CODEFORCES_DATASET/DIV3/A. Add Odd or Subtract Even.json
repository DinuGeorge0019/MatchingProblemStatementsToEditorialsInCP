Add Odd or Subtract Even", "statement": "You are given two positive integers  and .In one move, you can   in the following way:  Choose any positive  integer  () and replace  with ;  choose any positive  integer  () and replace  with . You can perform as many such operations as you want. You can choose the same numbers  and  in different moves.Your task is to find the minimum number of moves required to obtain  from . It is guaranteed that you can always obtain  from .You have to answer  independent test cases.", "input": "The first line of the input contains one integer  () \u2014 the number of test cases.
