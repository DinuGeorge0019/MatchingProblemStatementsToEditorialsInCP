Two-gram", "statement": "Two-gram is an ordered pair (i.e. string of length two) of capital Latin letters. For example, \"\", \"\", \"\" \u2014 three distinct two-grams.You are given a string  consisting of  capital Latin letters. Your task is to find  two-gram contained in the given string  (i.e. two consecutive characters of the string) maximal number of times. For example, for string  = \"\" the answer is two-gram \"\", which contained in  three times. In other words, find any most frequent two-gram.Note that occurrences of the two-gram can overlap with each other.", "input": "The first line of the input contains integer number  () \u2014 the length of string .
