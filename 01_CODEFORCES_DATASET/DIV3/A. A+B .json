A+B ", "statement": "You are given an expression of the form , where  and  are integers from  to . You have to evaluate it and print the result.", "input": "The first line contains one integer  () \u2014 the number of test cases. Each test case consists of one line containing an expression of the form  (, both  and  are integers). The integers are  separated from the  sign.", "output": "For each test case, print one integer \u2014 the result of the expression.", "tutorial": "There are multiple ways to solve this problem.Most interpreted languages have some function that takes the string, evaluates it as code, and then returns the result. One of the examples is the  function in Python. If the language you use supports something like that, you can read the input as a string and use it as the argument of such a function.Suppose you use a language where this is impossible. There are still many approaches to this problem. The most straightforward one is to take the first and the last characters of the input string, calculate their ASCII codes, and then subtract the ASCII code of the character  from them to get these digits as integers, not as characters. Then you can just add them up and print the result.", "solution": "t = int(input())\nfor i in range(t):\n    print(eval(input()))", "interactive": false, "noSolution": false, "noTutorial": false}
