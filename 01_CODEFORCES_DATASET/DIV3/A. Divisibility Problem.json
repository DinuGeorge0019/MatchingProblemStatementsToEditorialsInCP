Divisibility Problem", "statement": "You are given two positive integers  and . In one move you can increase  by  (replace  with ). Your task is to find the minimum number of moves you need to do in order to make  divisible by . It is possible, that you have to make  moves, as  is already divisible by . You have to answer  independent test cases.", "input": "The first line of the input contains one integer  () \u2014 the number of test cases. Then  test cases follow. The only line of the test case contains two integers  and  ().", "output": "For each test case print the answer \u2014 the minimum number of moves you need to do in order to make  divisible by .", "tutorial": "If  ( is divisible by ), just print .
