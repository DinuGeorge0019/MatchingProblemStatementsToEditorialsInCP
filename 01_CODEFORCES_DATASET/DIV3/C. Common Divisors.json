Common Divisors", "statement": "You are given an array  consisting of  integers.Your task is to say the number of such positive integers  such that  divides  number from the array. In other words, you have to find the number of common divisors of all elements in the array.For example, if the array  will be , then  and  divide each number from the array (so the answer for this test is ).", "input": "The first line of the input contains one integer  () \u2014 the number of elements in . The second line of the input contains  integers  (), where  is the -th element of .", "output": "Print one integer \u2014 the number of such positive integers  such that  divides  number from the given array (in other words, the answer is the number of common divisors of all elements in the array).", "tutorial": "Let  is the greatest common divisor of all elements of the array. You can find it by Euclidean algorithm or some standard library functions. Then the answer is just the number of divisors of . You can find this value in .", "solution": "#include <bits/stdc++.h>\n\nusing namespace std;\n\nint main() {\n#ifdef _DEBUG\n\tfreopen(\"input.txt\", \"r\", stdin);\n//\tfreopen(\"output.txt\", \"w\", stdout);\n#endif\n\t\n\tint n;\n\tcin >> n;\n\tlong long g = 0;\n\tfor (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {\n\t\tlong long x;\n\t\tcin >> x;\n\t\tg = __gcd(g, x);\n\t}\n\t\n\tint ans = 0;\n\tfor (int i = 1; i * 1ll * i <= g; ++i) {\n\t\tif (g % i == 0) {\n\t\t\t++ans;\n\t\t\tif (i != g / i) {\n\t\t\t\t++ans;\n\t\t\t}\n\t\t}\n\t}\n\t\n\tcout << ans << endl;\n\t\n\treturn 0;\n}", "interactive": false, "noSolution": false, "noTutorial": false}
