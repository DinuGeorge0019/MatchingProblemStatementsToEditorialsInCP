Two distinct points", "statement": "You are given two segments  and  on the -axis. It is guaranteed that  and . Segments .     Your problem is to find two   and  such that ,  and . In other words, you have to choose two  integer points in such a way that the first point belongs to the segment  and the second one belongs to the segment .It is guaranteed that . If there are multiple answers, you can print  of them.You have to answer  independent queries.", "input": "The first line of the input contains one integer  () \u2014 the number of queries. Each of the next  lines contains four integers  and  () \u2014 the ends of the segments in the -th query.", "output": "Print  integers. For the -th query print two integers  and  \u2014 such numbers that ,  and . Queries are numbered in order of the input. It is guaranteed that . If there are multiple answers, you can print .", "tutorial": "One of the possible answers is always a pair of endpoints of the given segments.
