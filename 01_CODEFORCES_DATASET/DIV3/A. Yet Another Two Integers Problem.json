Yet Another Two Integers Problem", "statement": "You are given two integers  and .In one move, you can choose some   from  to  and add it to  or subtract it from . In other words, you choose an integer  and perform  or . You may use  values of  in different moves.Your task is to find the  number of moves required to obtain  from .You have to answer  independent test cases.", "input": "The first line of the input contains one integer  () \u2014 the number of test cases. Then  test cases follow. The only line of the test case contains two integers  and  ().", "output": "For each test case, print the answer: the minimum number of moves required to obtain  from .", "tutorial": "We can add or subtract  until the difference between  and  becomes less than . And if it is not  after all such moves, we need one additional move.Let  is the absolute difference between  and . The final answer is  plus one if .
