Chips Moving", "statement": "You are given  chips on a number line. The -th chip is placed at the integer coordinate . Some chips .You can perform each of the two following types of moves any (possibly, zero) number of times on any chip:  Move the chip  by  to the left or  to the right  (i.e. replace the current coordinate  with  or with );  move the chip  by  to the left or  to the right and pay  for this move (i.e. replace the current coordinate  with  or with ). Note that it's allowed to move chips to any integer coordinate, including negative and zero.Your task is to find the minimum total number of coins required to move all  chips to the same coordinate (i.e. all  should be equal after some sequence of moves).", "input": "The first line of the input contains one integer  () \u2014 the number of chips. The second line of the input contains  integers  (), where  is the coordinate of the -th chip.", "output": "Print one integer \u2014 the minimum total number of coins required to move all  chips to the same coordinate.", "tutorial": "We can see that the only information we need is the parity of the coordinate of each chip (because we can move all chips that have the same parity to one coordinate for free). So if the number of chips with odd coordinate is  then the answer is .", "solution": "#include <bits/stdc++.h>\n\nusing namespace std;\n\nint main() {\n#ifdef _DEBUG\n\tfreopen(\"input.txt\", \"r\", stdin);\n//\tfreopen(\"output.txt\", \"w\", stdout);\n#endif\n\t\n\tint n;\n\tcin >> n;\n\tint cnto = 0;\n\tfor (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {\n\t\tint x;\n\t\tcin >> x;\n\t\tcnto += x & 1;\n\t}\n\t\n\tcout << min(cnto, n - cnto) << endl;\n\t\n\treturn 0;\n}", "interactive": false, "noSolution": false, "noTutorial": false}
