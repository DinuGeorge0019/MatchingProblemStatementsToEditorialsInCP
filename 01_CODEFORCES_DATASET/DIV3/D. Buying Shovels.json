Buying Shovels", "statement": "Polycarp wants to buy   shovels. The shop sells packages with shovels. The store has  types of packages: the package of the -th type consists of exactly  shovels (). The store has an infinite number of packages of each type.Polycarp wants to choose  type of packages and then buy several (one or more) packages of this type. What is the smallest number of packages Polycarp will have to buy to get exactly  shovels?For example, if  and , then Polycarp will buy  packages of  shovels.Help Polycarp find the minimum number of packages that he needs to buy, given that he:   will buy exactly  shovels in total;  the sizes of  packages he will buy are all the same and the number of shovels in each package is an integer from  to , inclusive. ", "input": "The first line contains an integer  ()\u00a0\u2014 the number of test cases in the input. Then,  test cases follow, one per line. Each test case consists of two positive integers  () and  ()\u00a0\u2014 the number of shovels and the number of types of packages.", "output": "Print  answers to the test cases. Each answer is a positive integer\u00a0\u2014 the minimum number of packages.", "tutorial": "If Polycarp buys  packages of  shovels and gets exactly  shovels in total, then , that is,  and  are divisors of . Then the problem reduces to the following, you need to find the maximum divisor of the number  not greater than . To do this, iterate over all the numbers  from  to  inclusive and check whether  is divisible by . If so, then  and \u00a0\u2014 are both divisors of  and you can use them to try to improve the answer.", "solution": "#include <bits/stdc++.h>\nusing namespace std;\n\nint main() {\n\tint test;\n\tcin >> test;\n\n\tfor (int tt = 0; tt < test; tt++) {\n\t\tint n, k;\n\t\tcin >> n >> k;\n\n\t\tint ans = n;\n\n\t\tfor (int j = 1; j * j <= n; j++) {\n\t\t\tif (n % j == 0) {\n\t\t\t\tif (j <= k) {\n\t\t\t\t\tans = min(ans, n / j);\n\t\t\t\t}\n\n\t\t\t\tif (n / j <= k) {\n\t\t\t\t\tans = min(ans, j);\n\t\t\t\t}\n\t\t\t}\n\t\t}\n\n\t\tcout << ans << endl;\n\t}\n\n\treturn 0;\n}", "interactive": false, "noSolution": false, "noTutorial": false}
