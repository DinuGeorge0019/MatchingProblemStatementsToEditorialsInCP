Odd Grasshopper", "statement": "The grasshopper is located on the numeric axis at the point with coordinate .Having nothing else to do he starts jumping between integer points on the axis. Making a jump from a point with coordinate  with a distance  to the left moves the grasshopper to a point with a coordinate , while jumping to the right moves him to a point with a coordinate .The grasshopper is very fond of positive integers, so for each integer  starting with  the following holds: exactly  minutes after the start he makes a jump with a distance of exactly . So, in the first minutes he jumps by , then by , and so on.The direction of a jump is determined as follows: if the point where the grasshopper was before the jump has an  coordinate, the grasshopper jumps to the ,  he jumps to the .For example, if after  consecutive jumps he arrives at the point with a coordinate , he will jump by a distance of  to the right, since  is an odd number, and will end up at a point . Since  is an even number, the next jump the grasshopper will make to the left by a distance of , and it will move him to the point .Find exactly which point the grasshopper will be at after exactly  jumps.", "input": "The first line of input contains an integer  ()\u00a0\u2014 the number of test cases. Each of the following  lines contains two integers  () and  ()\u00a0\u2014 the coordinate of the grasshopper's initial position and the number of jumps.", "output": "Print exactly  lines. On the -th line print one integer\u00a0\u2014 the answer to the -th test case\u00a0\u2014 the coordinate of the point the grasshopper will be at after making  jumps from the point .", "tutorial": "Consider the first four actions that the grasshopper will perform, starting at a point with coordinate :   coordinate  is , jumping  to  leads to   coordinate  is , jumping  to  leads to   coordinate  is , jumping  to  leads to   coordinate  is , jumping  to  leads to  If you look closely at the next four jumps, they follow the same pattern: jump to the left, two jumps to the right, jump to the left. In general, making jumps with numbers , the grasshopper will start from coordinate  and move as Thus, if  were always zero, the answer would be    if    if    if    if  is divisible by  Let's find an answer for the cases when . But if  is even, then all steps will follow the same directions, and the answer will be , where  is the answer for the same  and starting point  (described above). And if  is odd, then all steps will have opposite directions, and the answer will be .", "solution": "t = int(input())\nmaps = [\n    lambda x: 0,\n    lambda x: x,\n    lambda x: -1,\n    lambda x: -x - 1\n]\n\nfor _ in range(t):\n    x0, n = map(int, input().split())\n    d = maps[n % 4](n)\n    print(x0 - d if x0 % 2 == 0 else x0 + d)", "interactive": false, "noSolution": false, "noTutorial": false}
