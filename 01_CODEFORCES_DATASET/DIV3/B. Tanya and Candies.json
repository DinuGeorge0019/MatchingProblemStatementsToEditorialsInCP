Tanya and Candies", "statement": "Tanya has  candies numbered from  to . The -th candy has the weight .She plans to eat exactly  candies and give the remaining candy to her dad. Tanya eats candies in order of increasing their numbers, .Your task is to find the number of such candies  (let's call these candies ) that if dad gets the -th candy then the sum of weights of candies Tanya eats in even days will be equal to the sum of weights of candies Tanya eats in odd days. Note that at first, she will give the candy, after it she will eat the remaining candies one by one.For example,  and weights are . Consider all possible cases to give a candy to dad:  Tanya gives the -st candy to dad (), the remaining candies are . She will eat  in the first day,  in the second day,  in the third day. So in odd days she will eat  and in even days she will eat . Since  this case shouldn't be counted to the answer (this candy isn't ).  Tanya gives the -nd candy to dad (), the remaining candies are . She will eat  in the first day,  in the second day,  in the third day. So in odd days she will eat  and in even days she will eat . Since  this case shouldn't be counted to the answer (this candy isn't ).  Tanya gives the -rd candy to dad (), the remaining candies are . She will eat  in the first day,  in the second day,  in the third day. So in odd days she will eat  and in even days she will eat . Since  this case  to the answer (this candy is ).  Tanya gives the -th candy to dad (), the remaining candies are . She will eat  in the first day,  in the second day,  in the third day. So in odd days she will eat  and in even days she will eat . Since  this case  to the answer (this candy is ). In total there  cases which should counted (these candies are ), so the answer is .", "input": "The first line of the input contains one integer  () \u2014 the number of candies.

Initially,  and  are ,  equals to the sum of  with odd  in a whole array and  equals to the sum of  with even  in a whole array.Let's iterate from left to right over all elements of the array. Let's consider the current element . If  is even, then set , otherwise let's set . Then let's consider we give the current candy to dad. Then we have to increase the answer if  and .
