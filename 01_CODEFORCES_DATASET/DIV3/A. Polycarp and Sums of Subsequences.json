Polycarp and Sums of Subsequences", "statement": "Polycarp had an array  of   integers. He wrote out the sums of all non-empty subsequences of this array, sorted them in non-decreasing order, and got an array  of  integers.For example, if , then Polycarp wrote out , , , , , , . After sorting, he got an array Unfortunately, Polycarp lost the array . He only has the array  left. Help him to restore the array .", "input": "The first line contains one integer  () \u2014 the number of test cases. Each test case consists of one line which contains  integers  (; ).  .", "output": "For each test case, print  integers \u2014 ,  and . If there can be several answers, print any of them.", "tutorial": "The order of elements in  doesn't matter. If there is at least one correct array , then we can sort it and get the answer in which . Therefore, we can always find a sorted array. Suppose that . Then , , . We can find  as .", "solution": "#include <bits/stdc++.h>\n\nusing namespace std;\n\n\n\nint main()\n{\n    ios_base::sync_with_stdio(0);\n    cin.tie(0);\n    cout.tie(0);\n    int t;\n    cin >> t;\n    for(int i = 0; i < t; i++)\n    {\n        vector <int> b(7);\n\n        for(int i = 0; i < 7; i++)\n            cin >> b[i];\n\n        cout << b[0] << ' ' << b[1] << ' ' << b[6] - b[0] - b[1] << endl;\n    }\n}", "interactive": false, "noSolution": false, "noTutorial": false}
