Yet Another Tetris Problem", "statement": "You are given some Tetris field consisting of  columns. The initial height of the -th column of the field is  blocks. On top of these columns you can place  figures of size  (i.e. the height of this figure is  blocks and the width of this figure is  block). Note that you  rotate these figures.Your task is to say if you can clear the whole field by placing such figures.More formally, the problem can be described like this:The following process occurs while :  You place one figure  (choose some  from  to  and replace  with );  then, while all  are greater than zero, replace each  with . And your task is to determine if it is possible to clear the whole field (i.e. finish the described process), choosing the places for new figures properly.You have to answer  independent test cases.", "input": "The first line of the input contains one integer  () \u2014 the number of test cases. The next  lines describe test cases. The first line of the test case contains one integer  () \u2014 the number of columns in the Tetris field. The second line of the test case contains  integers  (), where  is the initial height of the -th column of the Tetris field.", "output": "For each test case, print the answer \u2014 \"\" (without quotes) if you can clear the whole Tetris field and \"\" otherwise.", "tutorial": "The answer is \"\" only if all  have the same parity (i.e. all  are odd or all  are even). That's because placing the block doesn't change the parity of the element and the  operation changes the parity of all elements in the array. ", "solution": "for i in range(int(input())):\n\tn = int(input())\n\tcnto = sum(list(map(lambda x: int(x) % 2, input().split())))\n\tprint('YES' if cnto == 0 or cnto == n else 'NO')", "interactive": false, "noSolution": false, "noTutorial": false}
