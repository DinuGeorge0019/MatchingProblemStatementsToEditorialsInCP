Vlad and a Pair of Numbers", "statement": "Vlad found two positive numbers  and  (). He discovered that , where  means the bitwise exclusive OR , and division is performed without rounding..Since it is easier to remember one number than two, Vlad remembered only , let's denote this number as . Help him find any suitable  and  or tell him that they do not exist.", "input": "The first line of the input data contains the single integer  ()\u00a0\u2014 the number of test cases in the test.  Each test case is described by a single integer  ()\u00a0\u2014 the number that Vlad remembered.", "output": "Output  lines, each of which is the answer to the corresponding test case. As the answer, output  and  (), such that . If there are several answers, output any of them. If there are no matching pairs, output .", "tutorial": "Consider the answer by bits. We know that if the th bit of the number  is zero, then these bits are the same for  and , otherwise they differ. Then let's first make , . Note that  is already equal to , but  is not yet. So we need to dial another  with matching bits, we will add them to both integers greedily, going from the highest bit to the lowest, skipping those bits that are already one in . If after this algorithm  and  do not satisfy the conditions, then the answer is . In total, this solution works for .You can see that in the solution above, we actually just added  to both numbers, which could only be done with one set of bits, so if the answer exists, the pair , .", "solution": "t = int(input())\nfor _ in range(t):\n    x = int(input())\n    a = x\n    b = 0\n    for i in range(32, -1, -1):\n        if x & (1 << i) > 0:\n            continue\n        if 2 * x - a - b >= (2 << i):\n            a += 1 << i\n            b += 1 << i\n    if a + b == 2 * x and a ^ b == x:\n        print(a, b)\n    else:\n        print(-1)", "interactive": false, "noSolution": false, "noTutorial": false}
