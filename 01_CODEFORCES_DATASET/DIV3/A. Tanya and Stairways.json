Tanya and Stairways", "statement": "Little girl Tanya climbs the stairs inside a multi-storey building. Every time Tanya climbs a stairway, she starts counting steps from  to the number of steps in this stairway. She speaks every number aloud. For example, if she climbs two stairways, the first of which contains  steps, and the second contains  steps, she will pronounce the numbers .You are given all the numbers pronounced by Tanya. How many stairways did she climb? Also, output the number of steps in each stairway.The given sequence will be a valid sequence that Tanya could have pronounced when climbing one or more stairways.", "input": "The first line contains  () \u2014 the total number of numbers pronounced by Tanya. The second line contains integers  () \u2014 all the numbers Tanya pronounced while climbing the stairs, in order from the first to the last pronounced number. Passing a stairway with  steps, she will pronounce the numbers  in that order. The given sequence will be a valid sequence that Tanya could have pronounced when climbing one or more stairways.", "output": "In the first line, output  \u2014 the number of stairways that Tanya climbed. In the second line, output  numbers \u2014 the number of steps in each stairway she climbed. Write the numbers in the correct order of passage of the stairways.", "tutorial": "The answer contains such elements  that .
