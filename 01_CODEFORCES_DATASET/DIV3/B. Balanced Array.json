Balanced Array", "statement": "You are given a positive integer , it is guaranteed that  is even (i.e. divisible by ).You want to construct the array  of length  such that:   The first  elements of  are even (divisible by );  the second  elements of  are odd (not divisible by );  ;  the sum of the first half equals to the sum of the second half (). If there are multiple answers, you can print any. It is  that the answer exists.You have to answer  independent test cases.", "input": "The first line of the input contains one integer  () \u2014 the number of test cases. Then  test cases follow. The only line of the test case contains one integer  () \u2014 the length of the array. It is guaranteed that that  is even (i.e. divisible by ). It is guaranteed that the sum of  over all test cases does not exceed  ().", "output": "For each test case, print the answer \u2014 \"\" (without quotes), if there is no suitable answer for the given test case or \"\" in the first line and  suitable array  () satisfying conditions from the problem statement on the second line.", "tutorial": "Firstly, if $$$n$$$ is not divisible by $$$4$$$ then the answer is \"\" because the parities of halves won't match. Otherwise, the answer is always \"\". Let's construct it as follows: firstly, let's create the array $$$[2, 4, 6, \\dots, n, 1, 3, 5, \\dots, n - 1]$$$. This array is almost good except one thing: the sum in the right half is exactly $$$\\frac{n}{2}$$$ less than the sum in the left half. So we can fix it easily: just add $$$\\frac{n}{2}$$$ to the last element.", "solution": "#include <bits/stdc++.h>\n\nusing namespace std;\n\nint main() {\n#ifdef _DEBUG\n\tfreopen(\"input.txt\", \"r\", stdin);\n//\tfreopen(\"output.txt\", \"w\", stdout);\n#endif\n\t\n\tint t;\n\tcin >> t;\n\twhile (t--) {\n\t\tint n;\n\t\tcin >> n;\n\t\tn /= 2;\n\t\tif (n & 1) {\n\t\t\tcout << \"NO\" << endl;\n\t\t\tcontinue;\n\t\t}\n\t\tcout << \"YES\" << endl;\n\t\tfor (int i = 1; i <= n; ++i) {\n\t\t\tcout << i * 2 << \" \";\n\t\t}\n\t\tfor (int i = 1; i < n; ++i) {\n\t\t\tcout << i * 2 - 1 << \" \";\n\t\t}\n\t\tcout << 3 * n - 1 << endl;\n\t}\n\t\n\treturn 0;\n}", "interactive": false, "noSolution": false, "noTutorial": false}
