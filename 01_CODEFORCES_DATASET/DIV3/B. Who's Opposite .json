Who's Opposite ", "statement": "Some number of people (this number is even) have stood in a circle. The people stand in the circle evenly. They are numbered clockwise starting from a person with the number . Each person is looking through the circle's center at the opposite person.     You don't know the exact number of people standing in the circle (but this number is even, no doubt). It is known that the person with the number  is looking at the person with the number  (and vice versa, of course). What is the number associated with a person being looked at by the person with the number ? If, for the specified , , and , no such circle exists, output .", "input": "The first line contains one integer  () \u2014 the number of test cases. Then  test cases follow. Each test case consists of one line containing three  integers , ,  ().", "output": "For each test case output in a separate line a single integer  \u2014 the number of the person being looked at by the person with the number  in a circle such that the person with the number  is looking at the person with the number . If there are multiple solutions, print any of them. Output  if there's no circle meeting the given conditions.", "tutorial": "The person with the number  looks at the person with the number  so the count of people standing to the left of  between  and  is equal to the count of people standing to the right of  between  and . Therefore, both counts are equal to , hence  must be a solution of the equation . The only solution of the equation is .Let's check that in the circle of  people can occur the numbers ,  and , i. e. let's check that . If it's false, there's no solution (output ).Since the person with the number  looks at the person with the number , the condition  must be met. Let's solve the equation for . There are two solutions:  ;  . We can output any of  such that . It's easy to prove that exactly one of the solutions meets the condition.", "solution": "#include <bits/stdc++.h>\n\nusing namespace std;\n\ntypedef long long ll;\n\nint main()\n{\n\tint t;\n\tcin >> t;\n\n\twhile (t--)\n\t{\n\t\tll a, b, c;\n\t\tcin >> a >> b >> c;\n\n\t\tll n = 2 * abs(a - b);\n\t\tif (a > n || b > n || c > n)\n\t\t\tcout << -1 << '\\n';\n\t\telse\n\t\t{\n\t\t\tll d = n / 2 + c;\n\t\t\twhile (d > n) d -= n;\n\t\t\tcout << d << '\\n';\n\t\t}\n\t}\n\treturn 0;\n}\n", "interactive": false, "noSolution": false, "noTutorial": false}
