Districts Connection", "statement": "There are  districts in the town, the -th district belongs to the -th bandit gang. Initially, no districts are connected to each other.You are the mayor of the city and want to build  two-way roads to connect all districts (two districts can be connected directly or through other connected districts).If two districts belonging to the same gang are connected  with a road, this gang will revolt.You don't want this so your task is to build  two-way roads in such a way that all districts are reachable from each other (possibly, using intermediate districts) and  of directly connected districts belong to , or determine that it is impossible to build  roads to satisfy all the conditions.You have to answer  independent test cases.", "input": "The first line of the input contains one integer  () \u2014 the number of test cases. Then  test cases follow. The first line of the test case contains one integer  () \u2014 the number of districts. The second line of the test case contains  integers  (), where  is the gang the -th district belongs to. It is guaranteed that the sum of  does not exceed  ().", "output": "For each test case, print:    on the only line if it is impossible to connect all districts satisfying the conditions from the problem statement.   on the first line and  roads on the next  lines. Each road should be presented as a pair of integers  and  (), where  and  are two districts the -th road connects.  For each road , the condition  should be satisfied. Also, all districts should be reachable from each other (possibly, using intermediate districts).", "tutorial": "If all districts belong to the same gang then the answer is . Otherwise, the answer is always  (yeah, as in the previous problem). How to construct it? Let's choose the first \"root\" as the district  and connect all such districts  that  to the district . So, all disconnected districts that remain are under control of the gang . Let's find any district  that  and just connect all remaining districts of the gang  to this district. This district always exists because we have at least two different gangs and it is connected to the remaining structure because its gang is not . So, all conditions are satisfied.", "solution": "#include <bits/stdc++.h>\n\nusing namespace std;\n\nint main() {\n#ifdef _DEBUG\n\tfreopen(\"input.txt\", \"r\", stdin);\n//\tfreopen(\"output.txt\", \"w\", stdout);\n#endif\n\t\n\tint t;\n\tcin >> t;\n\twhile (t--) {\n\t\tint n;\n\t\tcin >> n;\n\t\tvector<int> a(n);\n\t\tfor (auto &it : a) cin >> it;\n\t\tvector<pair<int, int>> res;\n\t\tint idx = -1;\n\t\tfor (int i = 1; i < n; ++i) {\n\t\t\tif (a[i] != a[0]) {\n\t\t\t\tidx = i;\n\t\t\t\tres.push_back({1, i + 1});\n\t\t\t}\n\t\t}\n\t\tif (idx == -1) {\n\t\t\tcout << \"NO\" << endl;\n\t\t\tcontinue;\n\t\t}\n\t\tfor (int i = 1; i < n; ++i) {\n\t\t\tif (a[i] == a[0]) {\n\t\t\t\tres.push_back({idx + 1, i + 1});\n\t\t\t}\n\t\t}\n\t\tcout << \"YES\" << endl;\n\t\tfor (auto [x, y] : res) cout << x << \" \" << y << endl;\n\t}\n\t\n\treturn 0;\n}", "interactive": false, "noSolution": false, "noTutorial": false}
