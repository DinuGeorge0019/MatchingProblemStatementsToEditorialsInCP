Polycarp and Coins", "statement": "Polycarp must pay   burles at the checkout. He has coins of two nominal values:  burle and  burles. Polycarp likes both kinds of coins equally. So he doesn't want to pay with more coins of one type than with the other.Thus, Polycarp wants to minimize the difference between the count of coins of  burle and  burles being used. Help him by determining two non-negative integer values  and  which are the number of coins of  burle and  burles, respectively, so that the total value of that number of coins is   (i.\u2009e. ), and the absolute value of the difference between  and  is as little as possible (i.\u2009e. you must minimize ).", "input": "The first line contains one integer  () \u2014 the number of test cases. Then  test cases follow. Each test case consists of one line. This line contains one integer  () \u2014 the number of burles to be paid by Polycarp.", "output": "For each test case, output a separate line containing two integers  and  () separated by a space where  is the number of coins of  burle and  is the number of coins of  burles. If there are multiple optimal solutions, print any one.", "tutorial": "Let's initialize variables  and  by the same value of . Then we need to gather additionally the remainder of dividing  by .If the remainder is equal to , we don't need to gather anything else because the variables  and  have been already set to the correct answer:  because  and no absolute value can be less than . Otherwise,  because  and  in this case, but that's impossible if  isn't divisible by 3.If the remainder is equal to , then we need to gather additionally  burle using one coin of  burle so let's increase  by . In this case, , hence , this value cannot be less than , as it was proved above.If the remainder is equal to , then we need to gather additionally  burles using one coin of  burles so let's increase  by . In this case, , hence , this value cannot be less than .There are no other remainders of dividing by  so these cases cover the whole solution.", "solution": "for i in range(0, int(input())):\n    n = int(input())\n    c1 = n // 3;\n    c2 = c1;\n    if n % 3 == 1:\n        c1 += 1\n    elif n % 3 == 2:\n        c2 += 1\n    print(c1, c2)", "interactive": false, "noSolution": false, "noTutorial": false}
