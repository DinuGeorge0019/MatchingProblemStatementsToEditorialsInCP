Frog Jumping", "statement": "A frog is currently at the point  on a coordinate axis . It jumps by the following algorithm: the first jump is  units to the right, the second jump is  units to the left, the third jump is  units to the right, the fourth jump is  units to the left, and so on.Formally:   if the frog has jumped an even number of times (before the current jump), it jumps from its current position  to position ;  otherwise it jumps from its current position  to position . Your task is to calculate the position of the frog after  jumps.But... One more thing. You are watching  different frogs so you have to answer  independent queries.", "input": "The first line of the input contains one integer  () \u2014 the number of queries. Each of the next  lines contain queries (one query per line). The query is described as three space-separated integers  () \u2014 the lengths of two types of jumps and the number of jumps, respectively.", "output": "Print  integers. The -th integer should be the answer for the -th query.", "tutorial": "With each pair of jumps of kind \"to the right \u2014 to the left\" the frog jumps . So the answer is almost . Almost because there can be one more jump to the right. So if  is odd then we have to add  to the answer.", "solution": "#include <bits/stdc++.h>\n\nusing namespace std;\n\nint main() {\n#ifdef _DEBUG\n\tfreopen(\"input.txt\", \"r\", stdin);\n//\tfreopen(\"output.txt\", \"w\", stdout);\n#endif\n\t\n\tint t;\n\tcin >> t;\n\tfor (int i = 0; i < t; ++i) {\n\t\tint a, b, k;\n\t\tcin >> a >> b >> k;\n\t\tcout << (a - b) * 1ll * (k / 2) + a * (k & 1) << endl;\n\t}\n\t\n\treturn 0;\n}", "interactive": false, "noSolution": false, "noTutorial": false}
