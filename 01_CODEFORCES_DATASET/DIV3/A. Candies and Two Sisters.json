Candies and Two Sisters", "statement": "There are two sisters Alice and Betty. You have  candies. You want to distribute these  candies between two sisters in such a way that:  Alice will get  () candies;  Betty will get  () candies;  each sister will get some  number of candies;  Alice will get a greater amount of candies than Betty (i.e. );  all the candies will be given to one of two sisters (i.e. ). Your task is to calculate the number of ways to distribute exactly  candies between sisters in a way described above. Candies are indistinguishable.Formally, find the number of ways to represent  as the sum of , where  and  are positive integers and .You have to answer  independent test cases.", "input": "The first line of the input contains one integer  () \u2014 the number of test cases. Then  test cases follow. The only line of a test case contains one integer  () \u2014 the number of candies you have.", "output": "For each test case, print the answer \u2014 the number of ways to distribute exactly  candies between two sisters in a way described in the problem statement. If there is no way to satisfy all the conditions, print .", "tutorial": "The answer is , where  is  rounded down.", "solution": "#include <bits/stdc++.h>\n\nusing namespace std;\n\nint main() {\n#ifdef _DEBUG\n\tfreopen(\"input.txt\", \"r\", stdin);\n//\tfreopen(\"output.txt\", \"w\", stdout);\n#endif\n\t\n\tint t;\n\tcin >> t;\n\twhile (t--) {\n\t\tint n;\n\t\tcin >> n;\n\t\tcout << (n - 1) / 2 << endl;\n\t}\n\t\n\treturn 0;\n}", "interactive": false, "noSolution": false, "noTutorial": false}
