Wrong Subtraction", "statement": "Little girl Tanya is learning how to decrease a number by one, but she does it wrong with a number consisting of two or more digits. Tanya subtracts one from a number by the following algorithm:  if the last digit of the number is non-zero, she decreases the number by one;  if the last digit of the number is zero, she divides the number by 10 (i.e. removes the last digit). You are given an integer number . Tanya will subtract one from it  times. Your task is to print the result after all  subtractions.It is guaranteed that the result will be positive integer number.", "input": "The first line of the input contains two integer numbers  and  (, ) \u2014 the number from which Tanya will subtract and the number of subtractions correspondingly.", "output": "Print one integer number \u2014 the result of the decreasing  by one  times. It is guaranteed that the result will be positive integer number. ", "tutorial": "In this problem you just need to simulate the process described in the statement (i.e.  times repeat the following operation: if  then  else ) and print the result.", "solution": "#include <bits/stdc++.h>\n\nusing namespace std;\n\nint main() {\n#ifdef _DEBUG\n\tfreopen(\"input.txt\", \"r\", stdin);\n//\tfreopen(\"output.txt\", \"w\", stdout);\n#endif\n\n\tint n, k;\n\tcin >> n >> k;\n\t\n\tfor (int i = 0; i < k; ++i) {\n\t\tif (n % 10 == 0) n /= 10;\n\t\telse n--;\n\t}\n\t\n\tcout << n << endl;\n\t\n\treturn 0;\n}", "interactive": false, "noSolution": false, "noTutorial": false}
