Linear Keyboard", "statement": "You are given a keyboard that consists of  keys. The keys are arranged sequentially in one row in a certain order. Each key corresponds to a unique lowercase Latin letter.You have to type the word  on this keyboard. It also consists only of lowercase Latin letters.To type a word, you need to type all its letters consecutively one by one. To type each letter you must position your hand exactly over the corresponding key and press it.Moving the hand between the keys takes time which is equal to the absolute value of the difference between positions of these keys (the keys are numbered from left to right). No time is spent on pressing the keys and on placing your hand over the first letter of the word.For example, consider a keyboard where the letters from '' to '' are arranged in consecutive alphabetical order. The letters '', '', '' and '' then are on the positions , ,  and , respectively. Therefore, it will take  units of time to type the word \"\". Determine how long it will take to print the word .", "input": "The first line contains an integer  ()\u00a0\u2014 the number of test cases. The next  lines contain descriptions of the test cases. The first line of a description contains a keyboard\u00a0\u2014 a string of length , which consists only of lowercase Latin letters. Each of the letters from '' to '' appears exactly once on the keyboard. The second line of the description contains the word . The word has a length from  to  letters inclusive and consists of lowercase Latin letters.", "output": "Print  lines, each line containing the answer to the corresponding test case. The answer to the test case is the minimal time it takes to type the word  on the given keyboard.", "tutorial": "Since it does not take time to place your hand over the first letter, you need to calculate the sum of the distances between the keyboard keys corresponding to each pair of adjacent letters of the word, that is  where  is the position of the keyboard key corresponding to the letter .In order to calculate this sum, let's just iterate through the word  with the  loop and find the differences between the positions of  and  on the keyboard. To find the position of a character on the keyboard, you could either use the built-in strings functions (such as  in Python or  in C++) or precalculate each letter's position on the keyboard into a separate array using another loop over a keyboard.", "solution": "t = int(input())\nfor _ in range(t):\n    k, s = input(), input()\n    res = 0\n    for i in range(1, len(s)):\n        res += abs(k.index(s[i]) - k.index(s[i - 1]))\n    print(res)", "interactive": false, "noSolution": false, "noTutorial": false}
