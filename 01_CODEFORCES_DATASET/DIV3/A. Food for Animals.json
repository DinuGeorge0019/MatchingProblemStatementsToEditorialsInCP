Food for Animals", "statement": "In the pet store on sale there are:   packs of dog food;   packs of cat food;   packs of universal food (such food is suitable for both dogs and cats). Polycarp has  dogs and  cats. Is it possible that he will be able to buy food for all his animals in the store? Each of his dogs and each of his cats should receive one pack of suitable food for it.", "input": "The first line of input contains an integer  ()\u00a0\u2014 the number of test cases in the input. Then  lines are given, each containing a description of one test case. Each description consists of five integers  and  ().", "output": "For each test case in a separate line, output:   , if suitable food can be bought for each of  dogs and for each of  cats;   else.  You can output  and  in any case (for example, strings , ,  and  will be recognized as a positive response).", "tutorial": "Obviously, the best way to buy food for every pet is to buy maximum possible food for dogs and cats, then  dogs and  cats will not get food. We will buy universal food for these dogs and cats.
