Number Transformation", "statement": "You are given two integers  and . You want to choose two  (greater than zero) integers  and , and then apply the following operation to    times: replace  with .You want to find two positive integers  and  such that  becomes equal to  after this process. If there are multiple possible pairs, you can choose . If there is no such pair, report it.For example:   if  and , you may choose  and , so that  becomes equal to ;  if  and , you may choose  and , so that  becomes equal to ;  if  and , there is no answer since you cannot decrease  with the given operations. ", "input": "The first line contains one integer  () \u2014 the number of test cases. Each test case consists of one line containing two integers  and  ().", "output": "If it is possible to choose a pair of positive integers  and  so that  becomes  after the aforementioned process, print these two integers.  (it can be shown that if the answer exists, there is a pair of integers  and  meeting these constraints). If there are multiple such pairs, print any of them. If it is impossible to choose a pair of integers  and  so that  becomes , print the integer  twice.", "tutorial": "The process in the statement can be rephrased as \"multiply  by \".  will be divisible by , so if  is not divisible by , there is no answer.
