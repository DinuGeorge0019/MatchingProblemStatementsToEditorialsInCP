Thermostat", "statement": "Vlad came home and found out that someone had reconfigured the old thermostat to the temperature of .The thermostat can only be set to a temperature from  to  inclusive, the temperature cannot change by less than . Formally, in one operation you can reconfigure the thermostat from temperature  to temperature  if  and .You are given , , ,  and . Find the minimum number of operations required to get temperature  from temperature , or say that it is impossible.", "input": "The first line of input data contains the single integer  ()\u00a0\u2014 the number of test cases in the test. The descriptions of the test cases follow. The first line of each case contains three integers ,  and  (, ) \u2014 range of temperature and minimum temperature change. The second line of each case contains two integers  and  () \u2014 the initial and final temperatures.", "output": "Output  numbers, each of which is the answer to the corresponding test case. If it is impossible to achieve the temperature , output , otherwise output the minimum number of operations.", "tutorial": "First let's consider the cases when the answer exists:  If , then the thermostat is already set up and the answer is .  else if , then it is enough to reconfigure the thermostat in  operation.  else if exist such temperature , that  and , then you can configure the thermostat in  operations. If such  exists between  and , we can chose one of bounds:  or .  we need to make  operations if times if we cannot reconfigure through one of the boundaries as above, but we can through both:  or  If we can't get the temperature  in one of these ways, the answer is .", "solution": "def solve():\n    l, r, x = map(int, input().split())\n    a, b = map(int, input().split())\n    if a == b:\n        return 0\n    if abs(a - b) >= x:\n        return 1\n    if r - max(a, b) >= x or min(a, b) - l >= x:\n        return 2\n    if r - b >= x and a - l >= x or r - a >= x and b - l >= x:\n        return 3\n    return -1\n\n\nt = int(input())\nfor _ in range(t):\n    print(solve())", "interactive": false, "noSolution": false, "noTutorial": false}
