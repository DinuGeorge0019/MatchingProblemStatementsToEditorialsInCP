He has invented his own cipher called .Repeating cipher is used for strings. To encrypt the string  (), Polycarp uses the following algorithm:  he writes down  ones,  he writes down  twice,  he writes down  three times,  ...  he writes down   times. For example, if =\"\" the process is: \"\"  \"\"  \"\". So the encrypted =\"\" is \"\".Given string  \u2014 the result of encryption of some string . Your task is to decrypt it, i.\u2009e. find the string .", "input": "The first line contains integer  () \u2014 the length of the encrypted string. The second line of the input contains  \u2014 the result of encryption of some string . It contains only lowercase Latin letters. The length of  is exactly . It is guaranteed that the answer to the test exists.", "output": "Print such string  that after encryption it equals .", "tutorial": "There are many possible approaches in this problem, I will describe one of the easiest.Let's print the initial string by the following algorithm: firstly, init the variable . Then, while the encrypted string isn't empty, print the first character of this string, remove  first characters from it and increase  by one.", "solution": "#include <bits/stdc++.h>\n\nusing namespace std;\n\nint main() {\n    int n;\n    cin >> n;\n    string s;\n    cin >> s;\n    int index = 0;\n    int gap = 1;\n    while (index < n)\n        cout << s[index], index += gap, gap++;\n}\n", "interactive": false, "noSolution": false, "noTutorial": false}
