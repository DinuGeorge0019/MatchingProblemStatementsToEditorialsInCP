Computer Game", "statement": "Vova is playing a computer game. There are in total  turns in the game and Vova really wants to play all of them. The initial charge of his laptop battery (i.e. the charge before the start of the game) is .During each turn Vova can choose what to do:   If the current charge of his laptop battery is strictly greater than , Vova can , and then the charge of his laptop battery will decrease by ;  if the current charge of his laptop battery is strictly greater than  (), Vova can  his laptop, and then the charge of his laptop battery will decrease by ;  if the current charge of his laptop battery is less than or equal to  and  at the same time then Vova cannot do anything and loses the game. .Vova wants to complete the game (Vova can complete the game if after each of  turns the charge of the laptop battery is ). Vova has to play . Among all possible ways to complete the game, Vova wants to choose the one where the number of turns when he  () is the  possible. It is possible that Vova cannot complete the game at all.Your task is to find out the  possible number of turns Vova can  (make the ) or report that Vova cannot complete the game.You have to answer  independent queries.", "input": "The first line of the input contains one integer  () \u2014 the number of queries. Each query is presented by a single line. The only line of the query contains four integers  and  () \u2014 the initial charge of Vova's laptop battery, the number of turns in the game and values  and , correspondingly.", "output": "For each query print one integer:  if Vova cannot complete the game or the  number of turns Vova can  (make the ) otherwise.", "tutorial": "Firstly, about the problem description. Vova really needs to  i.\u2009e. play . Exactly  turns. Among all possible ways to do it he need choose one where the number of turns when he  (this is the first type turn!) is .Suppose the answer is . Then the charge of the battery after  turns will be . If this value is greater than  then the answer is . Otherwise we need to replace some turns when Vova  with turns when Vova . The charge of the battery will increase by  avfter one replacement. We have to obtain  with some replacements. The number of turns to do it is equals to , where  is  divided by  rounded up. If  then the answer is . Otherwise the answer is .", "solution": "#include <bits/stdc++.h>\n\nusing namespace std;\n\nint main() {\n#ifdef _DEBUG\n\tfreopen(\"input.txt\", \"r\", stdin);\n//\tfreopen(\"output.txt\", \"w\", stdout);\n#endif\n\t\n\tint q;\n\tcin >> q;\n\tfor (int i = 0; i < q; ++i) {\n\t\tlong long k, n, a, b;\n\t\tcin >> k >> n >> a >> b;\n\t\tk -= n * a;\n\t\tif (k > 0) {\n\t\t\tcout << n << endl;\n\t\t} else {\n\t\t\tk = -k;\n\t\t\t++k;\n\t\t\tlong long diff = a - b;\n\t\t\tlong long turns = (k + diff - 1) / diff;\n\t\t\tif (turns > n) {\n\t\t\t\tcout << -1 << '\\n';\n\t\t\t} else {\n\t\t\t\tcout << n - turns << '\\n';\n\t\t\t}\n\t\t}\n\t}\n\t\n\treturn 0;\n}", "interactive": false, "noSolution": false, "noTutorial": false}
