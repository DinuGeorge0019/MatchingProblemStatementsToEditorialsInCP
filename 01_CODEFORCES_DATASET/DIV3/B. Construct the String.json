Construct the String", "statement": "You are given three positive integers ,  and . You have to construct a string  of length  consisting of lowercase Latin letters such that  of length  has   distinct letters. It is guaranteed that the answer exists.You have to answer  independent test cases.Recall that the substring  is the string  and its length is . In this problem you are only interested in substrings of length .", "input": "The first line of the input contains one integer  () \u2014 the number of test cases. Then  test cases follow. The only line of a test case contains three space-separated integers ,  and  (), where  is the length of the required string,  is the length of a substring and  is the required number of distinct letters in each substring of length . It is guaranteed that the sum of  over all test cases does not exceed  ().", "output": "For each test case, print the answer \u2014 such a string  of length  consisting of lowercase Latin letters that  of length  has   distinct letters. If there are multiple valid answers, print any of them. It is guaranteed that the answer exists.", "tutorial": "If we represent letters with digits, then the answer can be represented as . There is no substring containing more than  distinct characters and each substring of length  contains exactly  distinct characters because of the condition .Time complexity: .", "solution": "#include <bits/stdc++.h>\n\nusing namespace std;\n\nint main() {\n#ifdef _DEBUG\n\tfreopen(\"input.txt\", \"r\", stdin);\n//\tfreopen(\"output.txt\", \"w\", stdout);\n#endif\n\t\n\tint t;\n\tcin >> t;\n\twhile (t--) {\n\t\tint n, a, b;\n\t\tcin >> n >> a >> b;\n\t\tfor (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {\n\t\t\tcout << char('a' + i % b);\n\t\t}\n\t\tcout << endl;\n\t}\n\t\n\treturn 0;\n}", "interactive": false, "noSolution": false, "noTutorial": false}
