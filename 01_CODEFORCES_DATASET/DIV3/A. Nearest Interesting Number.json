Nearest Interesting Number", "statement": "Polycarp knows that if the sum of the digits of a number is divisible by , then the number itself is divisible by . He assumes that the numbers, the sum of the digits of which is divisible by , are also somewhat interesting. Thus, he considers a positive integer  interesting if its sum of digits is divisible by .Help Polycarp find the nearest larger or equal interesting number for the given number . That is, find the interesting number  such that  and  is minimal.", "input": "The only line in the input contains an integer  ().", "output": "Print the nearest greater or equal interesting number for the given number . In other words, print the interesting number  such that  and  is minimal.", "tutorial": "Even if we will iterate over all possible numbers starting from  and check if sum of digits of the current number is divisible by , we will find the answer very fast. The maximum possible number of iterations is no more than .", "solution": "#include <bits/stdc++.h>\n\nusing namespace std;\n\n#define forn(i, n) for (int i = 0; i < int(n); i++)\n\nint sum(int a) {\n    int result = 0;\n    while (a > 0) {\n        result += a % 10;\n        a /= 10;\n    }\n    return result;\n}\n\nint main() {\n    int a;\n    cin >> a;\n    while (sum(a) % 4 != 0) {\n        a++;\n    }\n    cout << a << endl;\n}\n", "interactive": false, "noSolution": false, "noTutorial": false}
