Collecting Coins", "statement": "Polycarp has three sisters: Alice, Barbara, and Cerene. They're collecting coins. Currently, Alice has  coins, Barbara has  coins and Cerene has  coins. Recently Polycarp has returned from the trip around the world and brought  coins.He wants to distribute  these  coins between his sisters in such a way that the number of coins Alice has is equal to the number of coins Barbara has and is equal to the number of coins Cerene has. In other words, if Polycarp gives  coins to Alice,  coins to Barbara and  coins to Cerene (), then . that A, B or C (the number of coins Polycarp gives to Alice, Barbara and Cerene correspondingly) can be 0.Your task is to find out if it is possible to distribute   coins between sisters in a way described above.You have to answer  independent test cases.", "input": "The first line of the input contains one integer  () \u2014 the number of test cases. The next  lines describe test cases. Each test case is given on a new line and consists of four space-separated integers  and  () \u2014 the number of coins Alice has, the number of coins Barbara has, the number of coins Cerene has and the number of coins Polycarp has.", "output": "For each test case, print \"\" if Polycarp can distribute   coins between his sisters and \"\" otherwise.", "tutorial": "Suppose . If it isn't true then let's rearrange our variables. Then we need at least  coins to make ,  and  equal. So if  then the answer is \"\". Otherwise, the answer if \"\" if the number  is divisible by . This is true because after making  and  equal we need to distribute all remaining candies between three sisters.", "solution": "#include <bits/stdc++.h>\n\nusing namespace std;\n\nint main() {\n#ifdef _DEBUG\n\tfreopen(\"input.txt\", \"r\", stdin);\n//\tfreopen(\"output.txt\", \"w\", stdout);\n#endif\n\t\n\tint q;\n\tcin >> q;\n\tfor (int i = 0; i < q; ++i) {\n\t\tint a[3], n;\n\t\tcin >> a[0] >> a[1] >> a[2] >> n;\n\t\tsort(a, a + 3);\n\t\tn -= 2 * a[2] - a[1] - a[0];\n\t\tif (n < 0 || n % 3 != 0) {\n\t\t\tcout << \"NO\" << endl;\n\t\t} else {\n\t\t\tcout << \"YES\" << endl;\n\t\t}\n\t}\n\t\n\treturn 0;\n}", "interactive": false, "noSolution": false, "noTutorial": false}
