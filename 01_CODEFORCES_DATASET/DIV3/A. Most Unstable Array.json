Most Unstable Array", "statement": "You are given two integers  and . You have to construct the array  of length  consisting of  (i.e. integers greater than or equal to zero) such that the sum of elements of this array is   and the value  is the maximum possible. Recall that  is the absolute value of .In other words, you have to maximize the sum of absolute differences between adjacent (consecutive) elements. For example, if the array  then the value above for this array is . Note that this example  but it shows how the required value for some array is calculated.You have to answer  independent test cases.", "input": "The first line of the input contains one integer  () \u2014 the number of test cases. Then  test cases follow. The only line of the test case contains two integers  and  () \u2014 the length of the array and its sum correspondingly.", "output": "For each test case, print the answer \u2014 the maximum possible value of  for the array  consisting of  non-negative integers with the sum .", "tutorial": "If  then the answer is . Otherwise, the best way is to construct the array . For  we can't reach answer more than  and for  we can't reach the answer more than  because each unit can't be used more than twice. So the answer can be represented as .", "solution": "#include <bits/stdc++.h>\n\nusing namespace std;\n\nint main() {\n#ifdef _DEBUG\n\tfreopen(\"input.txt\", \"r\", stdin);\n//\tfreopen(\"output.txt\", \"w\", stdout);\n#endif\n\t\n\tint t;\n\tcin >> t;\n\twhile (t--) {\n\t\tint n, m;\n\t\tcin >> n >> m;\n\t\tcout << min(2, n - 1) * m << endl;\n\t}\n\t\n\treturn 0;\n}", "interactive": false, "noSolution": false, "noTutorial": false}
