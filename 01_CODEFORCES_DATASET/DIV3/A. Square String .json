You can output  and  in any case (for example, strings , ,  and  will be recognized as a positive response).", "tutorial": "If the length of the given string  is odd, then the answer is , since adding two strings cannot do that. Otherwise, let  be the length of the string. Let's go through the first half of the string, comparing whether its first and  characters are equal, its second and  characters are equal, and so on.
