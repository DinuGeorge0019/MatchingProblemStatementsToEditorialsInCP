Same Sum Blocks  Easy ", "statement": "You are given an array of integers  A  is a sequence of contiguous (consecutive) elements  (). Thus, a block is defined by a pair of indices .Find a set of blocks  such that:  They do not intersect (i.e. they are disjoint). Formally, for each pair of blocks  and ) where  either  or .  For each block the sum of its elements is the same. Formally,     The number of the blocks in the set is maximum. Formally, there does not exist a set of blocks  satisfying the above two requirements with .      Write a program to find such a set of blocks.", "input": "The first line contains integer  () \u2014 the length of the given array. The second line contains the sequence of elements  ().", "output": "In the first line print the integer  (). The following  lines should contain blocks, one per line. In each line print a pair of indices  () \u2014 the bounds of the -th block. You can print blocks in any order.
