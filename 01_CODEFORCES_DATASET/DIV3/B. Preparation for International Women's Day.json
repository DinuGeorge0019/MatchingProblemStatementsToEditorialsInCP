Preparation for International Women's Day", "statement": "International Women's Day is coming soon! Polycarp is preparing for the holiday.There are  candy boxes in the shop for sale. The -th box contains  candies.Polycarp wants to prepare the maximum number of gifts for  girls. Each gift will consist of  boxes. The girls should be able to share each gift equally, so the total amount of candies in a gift (in a pair of boxes) should be divisible by . In other words, two boxes  and  () can be combined as a gift if  is divisible by .How many boxes will Polycarp be able to give? Of course, each box can be a part of no more than one gift. Polycarp cannot use boxes \"partially\" or redistribute candies between them. ", "input": "The first line of the input contains two integers  and  () \u2014 the number the boxes and the number the girls.
