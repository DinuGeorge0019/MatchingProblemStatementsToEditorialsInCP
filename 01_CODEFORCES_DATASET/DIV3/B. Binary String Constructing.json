Binary String Constructing", "statement": "You are given three integers ,  and . Your task is to construct a binary string  of length  such that there are exactly  zeroes, exactly  ones and exactly  indices  (where ) such that .

For the string \"\" there are two such indices  ().Recall that binary string is a non-empty sequence of characters where each character is either  or .", "input": "The first line of the input contains three integers ,  and  (.", "output": "Print only one string , where  is  binary string satisfying conditions described above.
