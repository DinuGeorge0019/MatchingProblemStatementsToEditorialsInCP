Polycarp and the Day of Pi", "statement": "On March 14, the day of the number  is celebrated all over the world. This is a very important mathematical constant equal to the ratio of the circumference of a circle to its diameter.Polycarp was told at school that the number  is irrational, therefore it has an infinite number of digits in decimal notation. He wanted to prepare for the Day of the number  by memorizing this number as accurately as possible.Polycarp wrote out all the digits that he managed to remember. For example, if Polycarp remembered  as , he wrote out .Polycarp was in a hurry and could have made a mistake, so you decided to check how many first digits of the number  Polycarp actually remembers correctly.", "input": "The first line of the input data contains the single integer  ()\u00a0\u2014 the number of test cases in the test.  Each test case is described by a single string of digits , which was written out by Polycarp. The string  contains up to  digits.", "output": "Output  integers, each of which is the answer to the corresponding test case, that is how many first digits of the number  Polycarp remembers correctly.", "tutorial": "In the problem, you had to find the largest common prefix(LCP) of the first  characters of the number  and the string . To do this, we will go from the beginning and compare the characters until we find a non-matching one, or until the string  ends.", "solution": "t = int(input())\npi = '31415926535897932384626433832795028841971693993751058209749445923078164062862089986280348253421170679'\nfor _ in range(t):\n    n = input() + '#'\n    for i in range(len(n)):\n        if pi[i] != n[i]:\n            print(i)\n            break", "interactive": false, "noSolution": false, "noTutorial": false}
