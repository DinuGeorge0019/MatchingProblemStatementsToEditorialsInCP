Payment Without Change", "statement": "You have  coins of value  and  coins of value . You always pay in exact change, so you want to know if there exist such  and  that if you take  () coins of value  and  () coins of value , then the total value of taken coins will be .You have to answer  independent test cases.", "input": "The first line of the input contains one integer  () \u2014 the number of test cases. Then  test cases follow. The only line of the test case contains four integers , ,  and  () \u2014 the number of coins of value , the number of coins of value , the value  and the required total value.", "output": "For the -th test case print the answer on it \u2014  (without quotes) if there exist such  and  that if you take  coins of value  and  coins of value , then the total value of taken coins will be , and  otherwise. You may print every letter in any case you want (so, for example, the strings , ,  and  will all be recognized as positive answer).", "tutorial": "Firstly, we obviously need to take at least  coins of value . If we cannot do it, the answer it . Otherwise we always can obtain the required sum  if .", "solution": "#include <iostream>\n\nusing namespace std;\n\nint main() {\n\tint q;\n\tcin >> q;\n\n\tfor (int qr = 0; qr < q; ++qr) {\n\t\tint a, b, n, s;\n\t\tcin >> a >> b >> n >> s;\n\n\t\tif (s % n <= b && 1ll * a * n + b >= s) {\n\t\t\tcout << \"YES\\n\";\n\t\t}\n\t\telse {\n\t\t\tcout << \"NO\\n\";\n\t\t}\n\t}\n}", "interactive": false, "noSolution": false, "noTutorial": false}
