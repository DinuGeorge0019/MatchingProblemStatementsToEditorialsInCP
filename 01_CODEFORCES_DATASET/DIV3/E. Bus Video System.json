Bus Video System", "statement": "The busses in Berland are equipped with a video surveillance system. The system records information about changes in the number of passengers in a bus after stops.If  is the number of passengers in a bus just before the current bus stop and  is the number of passengers in the bus just after current bus stop, the system records the number . So the system records show how number of passengers changed.The test run was made for single bus and  bus stops. Thus, the system recorded the sequence of integers  (exactly one number for each bus stop), where  is the record for the bus stop . The bus stops are numbered from  to  in chronological order.Determine the number of possible ways how many people could be in the bus before the first bus stop, if the bus has a capacity equals to  (that is, at any time in the bus there should be from  to  passengers inclusive).", "input": "The first line contains two integers  and   \u2014 the number of bus stops and the capacity of the bus. The second line contains a sequence  , where  equals to the number, which has been recorded by the video system after the -th bus stop.", "output": "Print the number of possible ways how many people could be in the bus before the first bus stop, if the bus has a capacity equals to . If the situation is contradictory (i.e. for any initial number of passengers there will be a contradiction), print .", "tutorial": "Firstly we should find the minimum and maximum numbers of passengers, which could be in a bus if initially it was empty. Let . We should iterate through the bus stops. For the -th bus stop, we add  to  and update with a value of  the minimum number of passengers  and the maximum number of passengers . If , it is an invalid case and we should print , because the maximum number of passengers should be less or equal to .Let  is a minimum possible number of passengers in the bus before the first stop and  \u2014 maximum possible.If  then in the bus initially were at least  passengers. Because we should make , else, .If , then , else, .After that we should compare  and . If  \u2014 print . In the other case, print , because each of those values is correct.", "solution": "#include <bits/stdc++.h>\n#define DIM 1007\nusing namespace std;\n\nlong long n,w,a[DIM],mx,curr,mn;\n\nint main()\n{\n    cin>>n>>w;\n    for(int i = 1; i<=n;++i)\n    {\n        cin>>a[i];\n        curr+=a[i];\n        mx = max(mx,curr);\n        mn = min(mn,curr);\n    }\n\n    long long first = -mn;\n    long long last = w - mx;\n\n    if(first > last) cout<<0;\n    else cout<<last -first+1;\n    return 0;\n}\n", "interactive": false, "noSolution": false, "noTutorial": false}
