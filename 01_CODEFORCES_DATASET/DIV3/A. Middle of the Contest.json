Middle of the Contest", "statement": "Polycarp is going to participate in the contest. It starts at  and ends at . It is guaranteed that the contest lasts an even number of minutes (i.e. , where  is  modulo ). It is also guaranteed that the entire contest is held during a single day. And finally it is guaranteed that the contest lasts at least two minutes.Polycarp wants to know the time of the midpoint of the contest. For example, if the contest lasts from  to  then the answer is , if the contest lasts from  to  then the answer is .", "input": "The first line of the input contains two integers  and  in the format . The second line of the input contains two integers  and  in the same format (). It is guaranteed that  and .

Just read them and then use some standard functions to transform them into integers (or we can do it manually).The second part is to obtain  and . Then let . It is the answer.We have to print  and , where  is  divided by  rounding down and  is  modulo .The only thing we should do more carefully is to print one leading zero before  if it is less than  and do the same for .", "solution": "#include <bits/stdc++.h>\n\nusing namespace std;\n\nint main() {\n#ifdef _DEBUG\n\tfreopen(\"input.txt\", \"r\", stdin);\n//\tfreopen(\"output.txt\", \"w\", stdout);\n#endif\n\t\n\tint h1, m1;\n\tscanf(\"%d:%d\", &h1, &m1);\n\tint h2, m2;\n\tscanf(\"%d:%d\", &h2, &m2);\n\tint t1 = h1 * 60 + m1;\n\tint t2 = h2 * 60 + m2;\n\tint t3 = (t1 + t2) / 2;\n\tprintf(\"%02d:%02d\\n\", t3 / 60, t3 % 60);\n\t\n\treturn 0;\n}", "interactive": false, "noSolution": false, "noTutorial": false}
