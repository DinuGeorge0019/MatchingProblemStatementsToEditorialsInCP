Compare T-Shirt Sizes", "statement": "Two T-shirt sizes are given:  and . The T-shirt size is either a string  or a string consisting of several (possibly zero) characters  and one of the characters  or .For example, strings , , ,  could be the size of some T-shirts. And the strings , ,  are not sizes.The letter  stands for medium,  for small,  for large. The letter  refers to the degree of size (from eXtra). For example,  is extra-extra-large (bigger than , and smaller than ).You need to compare two given sizes of T-shirts  and .The T-shirts are compared as follows:   any small size (no matter how many letters ) is smaller than the medium size and any large size;  any large size (regardless of the number of letters ) is larger than the medium size and any small size;  the more letters  before , the smaller the size;  the more letters  in front of , the larger the size. For example:    <    >    >    =    <    >  ", "input": "The first line of the input contains a single integer  ()\u00a0\u2014 the number of test cases. Each test case consists of one line, in which  and  T-shirt sizes are written. The lengths of the strings corresponding to the T-shirt sizes do not exceed . It is guaranteed that all sizes are correct.", "output": "For each test case, print on a separate line the result of comparing  and  T-shirt sizes (lines \"\", \"\" or \"\" without quotes).", "tutorial": "Let ,  are the last characters of lines  and  respectively. And  are the sizes of these strings.  : then the answer depends only on  and  and is uniquely defined as the inverse of  to  (\"\" if , \"\" if , since the characters , ,  are in reverse order in the alphabet).  :   . Then the answer is \"\". This also covers the case ;  . Then the larger the size of the string, the smaller the size of the t-shirt. That is, the answer is \"\" if  and \"\" if ;  .
