Number Replacement", "statement": "An integer array  is being transformed into an array of lowercase English letters using the following prodecure:While there is at least one number in the array:   Choose any number  from the array , and any letter of the English alphabet .  Replace all occurrences of number  with the letter . For example, if we initially had an array , then we could transform it the following way:  Choose the number  and the letter . After that .  Choose the number  and the letter . After that .  Choose the number  and the letter . After that .  Choose the number  and the letter . After that . After the transformation all letters are united into a string, in our example we get the string \"\".Having the array  and the string  determine if the string  could be got from the array  after the described transformation?", "input": "The first line contains a single integer  ) \u2014 the number of test cases. Then the description of the test cases follows. The first line of each test case contains a single integer  () \u2014 the length of the array  and the string . The second line of each test case contains exactly  integers:  () \u2014 the elements of the array . The third line of each test case contains a string  of length , consisting of lowercase English letters. ", "output": "For each test case, output \"\", if we can get the string  from the array , and \"\" otherwise. You can output each letter in any case.", "tutorial": "Let's note that if , then  must be equal to , since we must change the same value to the same letter. If we check this for all pairs of  and  and find no such contradictions, then the answer is \"\", otherwise \"\".We got the solution for  for one test case.", "solution": "#include<bits/stdc++.h>\nusing namespace std;\n\nint t,n;\nint a[100];\nstring s;\nchar to[60];\nbool dali;\n\nint main(){\n\n    ios_base::sync_with_stdio(0);\n    cin.tie(0);\n    cout.tie(0);\n\n    cin>>t;\n    for(int i=1;i<=t;i++){\n        cin>>n;\n        for(int f=0;f<n;f++){\n            cin>>a[f];\n        }\n        cin>>s;\n        for(int f=0;f<60;f++)to[f]=-1;\n        dali=true;\n\n        for(int f=0;f<s.size();f++){\n            if(to[a[f]]==-1)to[a[f]]=s[f];\n            else if(to[a[f]]!=s[f]){\n                dali=false; cout<<\"NO\\n\"; break;\n            }\n        }\n\n        if(dali)cout<<\"YES\\n\";\n    }\n\n    return 0;\n}\n", "interactive": false, "noSolution": false, "noTutorial": false}
