You can perform the following operation on them:  select any element  () and divide it by  (round down). In other words, you can replace any selected element  with the value  (where  is \u2013 round down the real number ). Output the minimum number of operations that must be done for a sequence of integers to become strictly increasing (that is, for the condition  to be satisfied). Or determine that it is impossible to obtain such a sequence. Note that elements  be swapped. The only possible operation is described above.For example, let  and a sequence of numbers  be given. Then it is enough to perform two operations on it:   Write the number  instead of the number  and get the sequence ;  Then replace  with  and get the sequence . The resulting sequence is strictly increasing because .", "input": "The first line of the input contains an integer  ()\u00a0\u2014 the number of test cases in the input. The descriptions of the test cases follow. The first line of each test case contains a single integer  (). The second line of each test case contains exactly  integers  ().", "output": "For each test case, print a single number on a separate line \u2014 the minimum number of operations to perform on the sequence to make it strictly increasing. If a strictly increasing sequence cannot be obtained, print \"\".", "tutorial": "We will process the elements of the sequence starting from the end of the sequence. Each element  () will be divided by  until it is less than .
