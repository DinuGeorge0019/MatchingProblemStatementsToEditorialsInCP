Squares and Cubes", "statement": "Polycarp likes squares and cubes of positive integers. Here is the beginning of the sequence of numbers he likes: , , , , ....For a given number , count the number of integers from  to  that Polycarp likes. In other words, find the number of such  that  is a square of a positive integer number or a cube of a positive integer number (or both a square and a cube simultaneously).", "input": "The first line contains an integer  () \u2014 the number of test cases. Then  lines contain the test cases, one per line. Each of the lines contains one integer  ().", "output": "For each test case, print the answer you are looking for \u2014 the number of integers from  to  that Polycarp likes.", "tutorial": "We'll search for positive integers not larger than , and add their squares or cubes to the set if they don't exceed . If , the maximum number Polycarp will like is , so the running time will be within the time limit.The answer to the problem is the length of the resulting set.", "solution": "#include <bits/stdc++.h>\n \nusing namespace std;\n \n#define forn(i, n) for (int i = 0; i < int(n); i++)\n \nint main() {\n    int t;\n    cin >> t;\n    forn(tt, t) {\n        int n;\n        cin >> n;\n        set<int> a;\n        for (int i = 1; i * i <= n; i++)\n            a.insert(i * i);\n        for (int i = 1; i * i * i <= n; i++)\n            a.insert(i * i * i);\n        cout << a.size() << endl;\n    }\n}", "interactive": false, "noSolution": false, "noTutorial": false}
