Domino  easy version ", "statement": "There's a table of  cells ( rows and  columns). The value of  is even.A domino is a figure that consists of two cells having a common side. It may be horizontal (one of the cells is to the right of the other) or vertical (one of the cells is above the other).You need to find out whether it is possible to place  dominoes on the table so that exactly  of them are horizontal and all the other dominoes are vertical. The dominoes cannot overlap and must fill the whole table.", "input": "The first line contains one integer  () \u2014 the number of test cases. Then  test cases follow. Each test case consists of a single line. The line contains three integers , ,  (, ,  is even) \u2014 the number of rows, columns and horizontal dominoes, respectively.", "output": "For each test case output \"\", if it is possible to place dominoes in the desired way, or \"\" otherwise.
