Advantage", "statement": "There are  participants in a competition, participant  having a strength of . Every participant wonders how much of an advantage they have over the other best participant. In other words, each participant  wants to know the difference between  and , where  is the strongest participant in the competition, not counting  (a difference can be negative).So, they ask you for your help! For each  () output the difference between  and the maximum strength of any participant other than participant .", "input": "The input consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains an integer  ()\u00a0\u2014 the number of test cases. The descriptions of the test cases follow. The first line of each test case contains an integer  ()\u00a0\u2014 the length of the array. The following line contains  space-separated positive integers , , ...,  ()\u00a0\u2014 the strengths of the participants. It is guaranteed that the sum of  over all test cases does not exceed .", "output": "For each test case, output  space-separated integers. For each  () output the difference between  and the maximum strength of any other participant.", "tutorial": "Make a copy of the array $$$s$$$: call it $$$t$$$. Sort $$$t$$$ in non-decreasing order, so that $$$t_1$$$ is the maximum strength and $$$t_2$$$\u00a0\u2014 the second maximum strength.Then for everyone but the best person, they should compare with the best person who has strength $$$t_1$$$. So for all $$$i$$$ such that $$$s_i \\neq t_1$$$, we should output $$$s_i - t_1$$$. Otherwise, output $$$s_i - t_2$$$\u00a0\u2014 the second highest strength, which is the next best person.", "solution": "#include <bits/stdc++.h>\n\nusing namespace std;\n\n#define forn(i, n) for (int i = 0; i < int(n); i++)\n\nint main() {\n    int t;\n    cin >> t;\n    forn(tt, t) {\n        int n;\n        cin >> n;\n        vector<int> a(n);\n        forn(i, n)\n            cin >> a[i];\n        vector<int> b(a);\n        sort(b.begin(), b.end());\n        forn(i, n) {\n            if (a[i] == b[n - 1])\n                cout << a[i] - b[n - 2] << \" \";\n            else\n                cout << a[i] - b[n - 1] << \" \";\n        }\n        cout << endl;\n   }\n}", "interactive": false, "noSolution": false, "noTutorial": false}
