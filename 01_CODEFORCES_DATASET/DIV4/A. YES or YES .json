For example, \"\", \"\", \"\" are all allowable.", "input": "The first line of the input contains an integer  ()\u00a0\u2014 the number of testcases. The description of each test consists of one line containing one string  consisting of three characters. Each character of  is either an uppercase or lowercase English letter.", "output": "For each test case, output \"\" (without quotes) if  satisfies the condition, and \"\" (without quotes) otherwise. You can output \"\" and \"\" in any case (for example, strings \"\", \"\" and \"\" will be recognized as a positive response).", "tutorial": "You should implement what is written in the statement. Here are three ways to do it:   Check that the first character is  or , check that the second character is  or , and check the third character is  or .  Make an array storing all acceptable strings (there are only ), and loop and see if any of the strings match the input.  Use some built-in function like  in C++ to make the string all lowercase, and check if  is equal to .
