Word Game", "statement": "Three guys play a game: first, each person writes down  distinct words of length . Then, they total up the number of points as follows:   if a word was written by one person\u00a0\u2014 that person gets 3 points,  if a word was written by two people\u00a0\u2014 each of the two gets 1 point,  if a word was written by all\u00a0\u2014 nobody gets any points.  In the end, how many points does each player have?", "input": "The input consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains an integer  ()\u00a0\u2014 the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows. The first line of each test case contains an integer  ()\u00a0\u2014 the number of words written by each person. The following three lines each contain   strings\u00a0\u2014 the words written by each person. Each string consists of  lowercase English characters.", "output": "For each test case, output three space-separated integers\u00a0\u2014 the number of points each of the three guys earned. You should output the answers in the same order as the input; the -th integer should be the number of points earned by the -th guy.", "tutorial": "You need to implement what is written in the statement. To quickly check if a word is written by another guy, you should store some  or Python dictionary, and increment every time you see a new string in the input. Then, you should iterate through each guy, find the number of times their word appears, and update their score. The complexity is  per testcase.", "solution": "#include <bits/stdc++.h>\n\nusing namespace std;\n\nconst int MAX = 200007;\nconst int MOD = 1000000007;\n\nvoid solve() {\n\tint n;\n\tcin >> n;\n\tmap<string, int> mp;\n\tstring a[3][n];\n\tfor (int i = 0; i < 3; i++) {\n\t\tfor (int j = 0; j < n; j++) {\n\t\t\tcin >> a[i][j];\n\t\t\tmp[a[i][j]]++;\n\t\t}\n\t}\n\tfor (int i = 0; i < 3; i++) {\n\t\tint tot = 0;\n\t\tfor (int j = 0; j < n; j++) {\n\t\t\tif (mp[a[i][j]] == 1) {tot += 3;}\n\t\t\telse if (mp[a[i][j]] == 2) {tot++;}\n\t\t}\n\t\tcout << tot << ' ';\n\t}\n\tcout << '\\n';\n}\n\nint main() {\n\tios::sync_with_stdio(false);\n\tcin.tie(nullptr);\n\tint tt; cin >> tt; for (int i = 1; i <= tt; i++) {solve();}\n\t// solve();\n}", "interactive": false, "noSolution": false, "noTutorial": false}
