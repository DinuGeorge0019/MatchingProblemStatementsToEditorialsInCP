Triple", "statement": "Given an array  of  elements, print any value that appears at least three times or print  if there is no such value.", "input": "The first line contains an integer  ()\u00a0\u2014 the number of test cases. The first line of each test case contains an integer  ()\u00a0\u2014 the length of the array. The second line of each test case contains  integers  ()\u00a0\u2014 the elements of the array. It is guaranteed that the sum of  over all test cases does not exceed .", "output": "For each test case, print any value that appears at least three times or print  if there is no such value.", "tutorial": "Approach 1:Sort the array using an efficient sorting algorithm. For every element check if the next two in the array are equal to it. If you find such an element output it. Time complexity is .Approach 2:Notice that elements have an upper bound of , you can use an auxiliary array to store the count of each value. Go through each value and see if its count is bigger than or equal to .
