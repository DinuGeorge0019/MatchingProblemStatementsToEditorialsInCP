As a spelling of his name, he allows any permutation of the letters of the name. For example, the following strings are valid spellings of his name: , , , . Note that the correct spelling must have uppercased  and lowercased other letters.Today he wrote string  of length  consisting only of uppercase or lowercase Latin letters. He asks you to check if  is the correct spelling of his name.", "input": "The first line of the input contains an integer  ()\u00a0\u2014 the number of test cases. The first line of each test case contains an integer  \u00a0\u2014 the length of string . The second line of each test case contains a string  consisting of only uppercase or lowercase Latin characters.", "output": "For each test case, output \"\" (without quotes) if  satisfies the condition, and \"\" (without quotes) otherwise. You can output the answer in any case (for example, the strings \"\", \"\", \"\" and \"\" will be recognized as a positive answer).", "tutorial": "Here are two solutions. Iterate through the string character by character. If , then ; otherwise, if  or , then  or . If the statement is false for any , the answer is . Otherwise it is . Replace all  with , since they are the same anyway. Then just check if the two strings are equal.In either case the complexity is  per testcase.", "solution": "#include <bits/stdc++.h>\n\nusing namespace std;\n\n#define forn(i, n) for (int i = 0; i < int(n); i++)\n\nint main() {\n    string name = \"Timur\";\n    sort(name.begin(), name.end());\n\n    int n;\n    cin >> n;\n    forn(i, n) {\n        int m;\n        cin >> m;\n        string s;\n        cin >> s;\n        sort(s.begin(), s.end());\n        cout << (s == name ? \"YES\" : \"NO\") << endl;\n    }\n}", "interactive": false, "noSolution": false, "noTutorial": false}
