Colourblindness", "statement": "Vasya has a grid with  rows and  columns. He colours each cell red, green, or blue.Vasya is colourblind and can't distinguish green from blue. Determine if Vasya will consider the two rows of the grid to be coloured the same.", "input": "The input consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains an integer  ()\u00a0\u2014 the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows. The first line of each test case contains an integer  ()\u00a0\u2014 the number of columns of the grid. The following two lines each contain a string consisting of  characters, each of which is either , , or , representing a red, green, or blue cell, respectively\u00a0\u2014 the description of the grid.", "output": "For each test case, output \"\" if Vasya considers the grid's two rows to be identical, and \"\" otherwise. You can output the answer in any case (for example, the strings \"\", \"\", \"\" and \"\" will be recognized as a positive answer).", "tutorial": "Here are two solutions. Iterate through the string character by character. If , then ; otherwise, if  or , then  or . If the statement is false for any , the answer is . Otherwise it is . Replace all  with , since they are the same anyway. Then just check if the two strings are equal.In either case the complexity is  per testcase.", "solution": "#include <bits/stdc++.h>\n\nusing namespace std;\n\nconst int MAX = 200007;\nconst int MOD = 1000000007;\n\nvoid solve() {\n\tint n;\n\tcin >> n;\n\tstring s, t;\n\tcin >> s >> t;\n\tfor (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {\n\t\tif (s[i] == 'R') {\n\t\t\tif (t[i] != 'R') {cout << \"NO\\n\"; return;}\n\t\t}\n\t\telse {\n\t\t\tif (t[i] == 'R') {cout << \"NO\\n\"; return;}\n\t\t}\n\t}\n\tcout << \"YES\\n\";\n}\n\nint main() {\n\tios::sync_with_stdio(false);\n\tcin.tie(nullptr);\n\tint tt; cin >> tt; for (int i = 1; i <= tt; i++) {solve();}\n\t// solve();\n}", "interactive": false, "noSolution": false, "noTutorial": false}
