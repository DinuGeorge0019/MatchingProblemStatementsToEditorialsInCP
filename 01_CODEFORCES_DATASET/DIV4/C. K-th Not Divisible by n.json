K-th Not Divisible by n", "statement": "You are given two positive integers  and . Print the -th positive integer that is not divisible by .For example, if , and , then all numbers that are not divisible by  are: . The -th number among them is .", "input": "The first line contains an integer  () \u2014 the number of test cases in the input. Next,  test cases are given, one per line. Each test case is two positive integers  () and  ().", "output": "For each test case print the -th positive integer that is not divisible by .", "tutorial": "Suppose the answer is just -th positive integer which we should \"shift right\" by some number. Each multiplier of  shifts our answer by . The number of such multipliers is , where  is  divided by  rounded down. So the final answer is  (-th positive integer with the required number of skipped integers multipliers of ).You can also use a binary search to solve this problem :)", "solution": "#include <bits/stdc++.h>\n\nusing namespace std;\n\nint main() {\n\tint t;\n\tcin >> t;\n\twhile (t--) {\n\t\tint n, k;\n\t\tcin >> n >> k;\n\t\tint need = (k - 1) / (n - 1);\n\t\tcout << k + need << endl;\n\t}\n}", "interactive": false, "noSolution": false, "noTutorial": false}
