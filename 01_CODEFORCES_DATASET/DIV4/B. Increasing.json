Increasing", "statement": "You are given an array  of  positive integers. Determine if, by rearranging the elements, you can make the array strictly increasing. In other words, determine if it is possible to rearrange the elements such that  holds.", "input": "The first line contains a single integer  ()\u00a0\u2014 the number of test cases. The first line of each test case contains a single integer  ()\u00a0\u2014 the length of the array. The second line of each test case contains  integers  ()\u00a0\u2014 the elements of the array.", "output": "For each test case, output \"\" (without quotes) if the array satisfies the condition, and \"\" (without quotes) otherwise. You can output the answer in any case (for example, the strings \"\", \"\", \"\" and \"\" will be recognized as a positive answer).", "tutorial": "If there are two elements with the same value, then the answer is , because neither of these values is less than the other.Otherwise, the answer is , since we can just sort the array.The time complexity is  or  depending on the implementation.", "solution": "#include <bits/stdc++.h>\nusing namespace std;\n\nvoid solve()\n{\n    int n;\n    cin >> n;\n    int x[n];\n    set<int> a;\n    for(int i = 0; i < n; i++)\n    {\n        cin >> x[i];\n    }\n    for(int i = 0; i < n; i++)\n    {\n        if(a.find(x[i]) != a.end())\n        {\n            cout << \"NO\" << endl;\n            return;\n        }\n        a.insert(x[i]);\n    }\n    cout << \"YES\" << endl;\n}\n\nint main()\n{\n    int t;\n    cin >> t;\n    while(t--)\n    {\n        solve();\n    }\n}", "interactive": false, "noSolution": false, "noTutorial": false}
