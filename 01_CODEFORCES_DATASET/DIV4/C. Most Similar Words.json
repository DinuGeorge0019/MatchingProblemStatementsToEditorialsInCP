Most Similar Words", "statement": "You are given  words of  length , consisting of lowercase Latin alphabet letters. The -th word is denoted .In one move you can choose  and change the letter at that position to the previous or next letter in alphabetical order. For example:  you can change '' to '' or to '';  '' can only be changed to '';  '' can only be changed to ''. The  between two words is the  number of moves required to make them equal. For example, the  between \"\" and \"\" is .Find the minimum  of  and  such that . In other words, find the minimum  over all possible pairs of the  words.", "input": "The first line of the input contains a single integer  () \u2014 the number of test cases. The description of test cases follows. The first line of each test case contains  integers  and  (, ) \u2014 the number of strings and their length respectively. Then follows  lines, the -th of which containing a single string  of length , consisting of lowercase Latin letters.", "output": "For each test case, print a single integer \u2014 the minimum  over all possible pairs of the given strings.", "tutorial": "Firstly, given any pair of strings of length , we should be able to tell the difference between them. It's enough to find the sum of absolute differences between each character from the same position. Now, we should go through all possible pairs and pick the minimum value over all of them using the function we use to calculate the difference.", "solution": "#include \"bits/stdc++.h\"\nusing namespace std;\n\nint cost(string& a, string& b) {\n    int val = 0;\n    for(int i = 0; i < a.size(); ++i) {\n        val += abs(a[i] - b[i]);\n    }\n    return val;\n}\n\nint main() {\n    int t; cin >> t;\n    while(t--) {\n        int n, m; cin >> n >> m;\n        vector<string> s(n);\n        for(int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {\n            cin >> s[i];\n        }\n        int ans = INT_MAX;\n        for(int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {\n            for(int j = i + 1; j < n; ++j) {\n                ans = min(ans, cost(s[i], s[j]));\n            }\n        }\n        cout << ans << \"\\n\";\n    }\n}", "interactive": false, "noSolution": false, "noTutorial": false}
